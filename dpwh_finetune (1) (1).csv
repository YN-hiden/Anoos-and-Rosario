LOOK | 500 VinFast Green GSM E-Taxis Arrive at Davao Port

About 500 electric taxis from Green GSM, powered by Vietnam’s VinFast, have arrived at Davao Port. The large shipment marks another milestone in Davao City’s continuing drive toward modern and sustainable transportation. It also reflects the growing confidence of investors and transport innovators in the city’s readiness to adopt clean energy solutions.

While the official launch details have yet to be announced, the e-taxis are expected to feature long-range batteries, fast charging, and quiet, zero-emission performance. VinFast’s compact electric models, similar to the VF 5 and VF 6 series, can travel up to 380 kilometers per charge. These vehicles are designed to deliver efficiency, comfort, and reliability for both drivers and passengers.

This development follows the launch of Maligaya E-Taxis in September, which introduced Davaoeños to the city’s first electric taxi fleet. Although only a few units have been deployed so far, the project has drawn strong public interest and support. It has also laid the groundwork for a broader shift toward cleaner and more innovative transport systems in the city.

With the arrival of the Green GSM fleet, Davao continues to lead Mindanao in adopting sustainable and future-ready mobility. The growing presence of electric taxis could enhance passenger experience and help reduce traffic-related emissions. It also aligns with Davao City’s long-term goal of building a modern, inclusive, and eco-friendly public transport network that reflects its vision as the Crown Jewel of Mindanao.

"The Politics of Fear and Deflection

When Congressman Marcoleta claimed that Senator Ping Lacson trembles at the thought of exposing Martin Romualdez and Zaldy Co, he wasn’t just throwing shade—he was cutting at the heart of our broken political theater. His line is simple: the moment real names with real power are about to be dragged under the spotlight, the conversation is derailed.

This is the oldest trick in the Manila playbook. Pretend to champion transparency, but once the trail points toward the Speaker of the House or a billionaire lawmaker, suddenly the script changes. Shift the focus, muddy the waters, talk circles until the public grows tired. It’s not courage; it’s choreography.

The rot isn’t only in who’s allegedly being shielded, but in how brazenly the shielding happens. If Romualdez and Co’s names are as central as Marcoleta insists, then dodging them isn’t just cowardice—it’s complicity. And complicity, in politics, is a currency more valuable than any committee seat or pork-barrel allocation.

The public deserves names, not half-truths. Fear of exposure should not dictate the national conversation. If Lacson or any lawmaker truly wants to be remembered for integrity, they shouldn’t blink when the powerful are mentioned. Silence is not neutral; it’s an alibi.

"The Syndicate Gambling Empire

Let’s connect the dots.

➡️ Corrupt politicians who pocketed billions from “Ghost Projects” are the same people investing in casinos, online platforms, and gambling ventures. Their dirty money didn’t vanish, it was laundered and reborn through the gambling industry. ⬇️

➡️ DSWD engineers and insiders involved in those billion-peso Ghost Projects were seen frequenting casinos, investing their loot to funnel stolen public funds into the  Casino system, disguised as “Winning.” ⬇️

➡️ The known personalities and kingpins of rival gambling empires, from traditional casinos to e-sabong, or sabgong are now being targeted, persecuted, or framed with fabricated cases?? The goal? To wipe out the competition and clear the playing field. ⬇️

➡️ POGOs were removed under the guise of moral cleanup. But PIGOs still operate.

Now ask yourself ,if gambling is the problem, why remove only one?

🛑Because the mission isn’t to protect Filipinos… it’s to consolidate control.

👉They eliminated the foreign players to give oligarchs and their political backers a clean monopoly over the Filipino market.

Loot → Launder → Legalize → Control.

"“PINAKAMALAKING KASINUNGALINGAN!” — GUANZON SA “NO AIR ASSETS” REPORT KAY ROMUALDEZ

Matapos ilabas ang ulat na walang nakarehistrong air assets sa pangalan ni dating House Speaker at Leyte Rep. Martin Romualdez, agad itong binanatan ni dating COA/Comelec Commissioner Atty. Rowena Guanzon sa social media.

“Pinakamalaking kasinungalingan! Alam ng lahat na chopper ang service ni Tamba kapag pumapasok sa House at bumibisita sa iba’t ibang probinsya para mangmudmod ng ayuda na feeling niya kanya. Huwag niyo kami pinagloloko,” saad ni Guanzon sa kanyang post.

Ang naturang pahayag ay reaksyon ni Guanzon sa ulat ng Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) na nagsasabing walang nakarehistrong air assets sa ilalim ng pangalan ni Romualdez.

Ito ay habang mino-monitor naman ng CAAP ang mga air assets ni dating Ako Bicol Rep. Zaldy Co, kabilang ang tatlong lumipad na palabas ng bansa.

Para kay Guanzon, hindi raw kapanipaniwala na walang koneksyon si Romualdez sa mga air assets, lalo’t madalas umano itong makita sa mga aktibidad sa probinsya na tila may sariling air transport.
Hindi rin nito pinalampas ang pagkakataon na batikusin ang tinawag niyang “pamimigay ng ayuda na parang personal na pondo.”

Muling binanatan ni Sen. Rodante Marcoleta ang Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) matapos hindi maisama sa mga rekomendadong kasuhan si Leyte Rep. at dating Speaker Martin Romualdez kaugnay ng multibillion-peso flood control scandal.

Sa panayam sa The Spokes ng Bilyonaryo News Channel, sinabi ni Sen.Marcoleta na bagaman “magandang simula” ang hakbang ng ICI laban kina Sen. Jinggoy Estrada, Sen. Joel Villanueva, at dating Ako Bicol Rep. Zaldy Co, dapat ding tugisin ang mga “malalaking isda.”

“It’s a good beginning. Pero sinasabi ko nga, hindi ko naman sinasabi na huwag nating habulin ang mga sapsap… Pero let us not forget yung malalaking isda sapagkat sila talaga ang promoter ng pagnanakaw ng pera ng bayan.”

Giit ni Marcoleta, dapat ipaliwanag ng ICI kung bakit hindi kasama si Romualdez sa listahan, lalo’t may sinumpaang salaysay si retired Marine T/Sgt. Orly Guteza na nagsabing personal niyang naideliver ang mga maletang puno ng pera sa bahay ng dating Speaker.

"Day 93 of The Philippine Corruption Scandal

October 30, 2025

Recently 24 Senators released their latest SALN, viewed by the public, almost all do not believe some of those who submitted. More in particular that of Senator Keso, his declaration made him the “poorest” of all in the group. How can he declare a measly  18 million worth when his wife’s supposed but chronicled shopping spree will further contradict that. Plus the viral Diamond (IDK the brand) ring that was gifted to her by Keso amounting to more or less $1,000,000. The nerve of some of these public servants to fool the people for their declaration. Ginagago literally ang taong bayan.

The ICI recently recommeded to the Ombudsman to file charges of public officials involve in this mess. A lot noticed that the former speaker was not in the list. My thoughts? If the President or the agency is dead serious in pursuing everybody involve in this mess, no stone left unturned and no one close to him must be spared. That is the only way he can leave a legacy.

Recommendations mean nothing if those involve will not be tried, convicted and jailed. The ICI could do better and this administration must as well.

Dinepensahan ni Sen. Rodante Marcoleta si retired Marine soldier Orly Guteza at sinabi na “most credible witness” ang huli kaugnay sa imbestigasyon ng Senate Blue Ribbon Committee sa umano’y anomalya sa flood control projects.

Sa isang panayam ngayong Huwebes, Oktubre 30, binatikos ni Marcoleta ang mga kumukuwestiyon kay Guteza matapos magdesisyon ang isang korte sa Maynila na ang kanyang sworn affidavit ay ninotaryo gamit ang pekeng pirma.

“Sino ba ‘yung tao sa likod ng napakalaking pandarambong sa kaban ng bayan? Hindi ba ‘yun ang ating layunin? Bakit ginigisa ninyo si Orly Guteza?” sabi ng senador.

"Hindi basta-basta ang mga kasong inirekomenda ng Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) laban sa mga sangkot sa umano’y iregularidad sa flood control projects, dahil ilan sa mga ito ay non-bailable o hindi maaaring piyansahan, ayon kay Presidential Communications Office (PCO) Undersecretary Atty. Claire Castro.

Ito ay kasunod ng rekomendasyon ng ICI sa Office of the Ombudsman na magsampa ng kasong kriminal at administratibo laban sa ilang dati at kasalukuyang opisyal ng pamahalaan, kabilang na ang plunder, direct at indirect bribery, at corruption of public officials.

Ayon kay Castro, posibleng makakita muli ang publiko ng mga “neck brace” at “wheelchair,” at posibleng humiling ng hospital arrest ang ilan, gaya ng nangyari noon sa ilang opisyal ng gobyerno na naharap sa mga kasong katiwalian.

Kabilang sa mga opisyal na inirekomenda ng ICI na kasuhan ay sina Senators Joel Villanueva, Jinggoy Estrada, at dating Ako Bicol Rep. Zaldy Co, pati na rin ang iba pang indibidwal na nadawit sa flood control scam.

".@392192773701614 Secretary Vince Dizon has formed a technical working group (TWG) to review all flood control projects before they receive funding or implementation approval starting in 2027. The move aims to ensure that future projects are backed by proper engineering plans and scientific assessments, following years of questionable and inefficient flood control efforts.

The panel includes @671959262148656 Undersecretary Carlos Primo David, who also heads the Water Resources Management Office, flood control systems expert Guillermo Tabios III, and Project NOAH Executive Director Mahar Lagmay. The group will vet proposals for technical soundness, environmental impact, and long-term effectiveness before any budget allocation is made.

“I’m asking this group to vet the plans. Walang papasok, under my watch, na (locally-funded) flood control project na hindi sasabihin ng group of experts na ‘to na, tama yan, okay yan, dapat gawin yan,” said Dizon.

The initiative follows President @861738054403097’s order to suspend all locally funded flood control projects for 2026, citing corruption and inefficiency within the Department of Public Works and Highways. Dizon said many projects were poorly planned and created merely “para pagkakitaan ng pera.”

For 2027, Dizon said the TWG will help the DPWH prepare its next budget with a more evidence-based framework. “They will come up with an initial plan. Kasi right now we are still awaiting the 18 Major River System Master Plan that will be done by our international partner agencies like the World Bank, ADB, and JICA. Next year yan lalabas, pero too late na yun kasi kailangan na nating magplano para sa 2027 budget starting now,” he said.

Lagmay said adopting a science-based approach would make DPWH’s flood control programs more effective, cost-efficient, and holistic. “Ang mga baha naman, hindi naman yan tumitigil sa administrative boundary ng munisipyo o city. So dapat yung assessment natin, pag-aaral natin coming from the mountains to the sea… Coordinated lahat—national pati local government units,” he explained.

The group is also expected to identify flood control structures that may have worsened flooding instead of preventing it. Engineer Tabios cited examples in Metro Manila where coastal road projects disrupted drainage systems. “By creating those coastal roadways, tapos hindi adequate yung drainage coming from inland, you create flooding inland. Hindi makalabas sa sea. That’s what happens if you don’t properly vet, evaluate the performance of whatever infrastructure na gagawin mo,” he said.

Dizon said the TWG’s creation is meant to end the cycle of wasteful, politically motivated flood control projects and move toward a data-driven approach to infrastructure development.

The announcement comes amid a string of controversies over alleged anomalies in flood control spending across the Philippines. Several lawmakers and local officials have been accused of funneling billions of pesos into “ghost” or overpriced projects under the guise of flood mitigation, raising concerns about systemic corruption within the DPWH. Investigations by the Commission on Audit and the Office of the Ombudsman have highlighted the lack of transparency and weak oversight in infrastructure funding—issues Dizon said the new technical panel aims to confront head-on.",Neutral

"#repost
**********

Why is Senator Ping Lacson so obsessed about trivializing or even casting doubts on the whole person of retired Philippine Marines M/Sgt Orly Guteza? 

By his own admission, he made his ""verification"" with Marines Commandant, M/Gen. Vince Blanco (PMA Class '91), and obtained information that ""Guteza is not and has never been under their custody.""

""How much more fakery can we take?"" Lacson, who is set to reassume the chairmanship of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, said in a post on ""X"" (formerly Twitter).

The negative posture of Lacson against Guteza is stinking. The whole nation cannot but notice he has no fondness (rather an outright dislike) for the brave ex-Marine.

In expressing exasperation about ""how much more fakery can we take?"" Lacson is generously painting the background of Guteza as shrouded with falsehoods.

So far, what has been found to be fake? The signature of the notary public, Atty. Petchie Rose Espera? 

Lacson is simply desperate about discrediting Guteza that he neglects the truth that it had no effect whatsoever on the validity of Espera's testimony.

For all intents and purposes, that affidavit has become irrelevant as evidentiary material before the Blue Ribbon Committee. Guteza's testimony has been memorialized in the official proceedings of the Blue Ribbon Committee. Lacson knows that, but pretends not to.

His own words betray the capriciousness of his own inquiry about Guteza's whereabouts. Why didn't he directly inquire from M/Gen. Blanco? Why qualify his information as having been obtained through ""fellow Cavaliers""? Was it done to shield his claim with a padding of deniability as it was not officially procured?

And what is Lacson's motive in ascertaining Guteza's exact whereabouts? Former Rep. Mike Defensor has publicly stated that the retired Marine was being protected by his band of brothers.

With the apparent danger that Guteza is now facing because of his bombshell of a testimony that landed squarely on the feet of former Speaker Martin Romualdez, it is necessary for him to stay well hidden. We cannot expect him and his protectors to hang a flag to pinpoint his exact location. It might even be possible that Defensor is deliberately misleading people who want to silence Guteza. Question: would such a deliberate effort to deceive his hunters diminish the evidentiary weight of Guteza's testimony? Obviously no.

At this point, the personal safety and security of Guteza is paramount. Thus far, he is the sole witness who has linked Romualdez to the flood control scam corruption. His testimony corroborates other testimony about kickback money being collected and delivered to resigned Ako Bicol party list Rep. Zaldy Co. Guteza established a link between Co as the collector of kickbacks to Romualdez as the mastermind.

What is important is that Guteza shows up before the Blue Ribbon and continue with his testimony.  It is there that Lacson and other Senators can poke deeper into what the ex-Marine knows and test his credibility before a national audience.

There is nothing fake about Guteza, Mr. Chairman.

Sa gitna ng kaliwa’t kanang alegasyon ng garapalang korapsyon sa mga flood control projects at iba pang isyu sa pamahalaan, iginiit ni Pangulong Marcos Jr. na nananatiling handa at maasahan ang Pilipinas bilang katuwang ng pandaigdigang negosyo.

Sa kanyang departure speech bago tumulak patungong Busan, South Korea para sa 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders’ Meeting, tiniyak ni Marcos Jr. na mananatiling bukas ang Pilipinas sa mga mamumuhunan:

“Nais kong gamitin ang pagkakataong ito upang muling pagtibayin ang katotohanang ang Pilipinas ay hindi lang handa — kundi maaasahan at forward-looking partner sa Asia-Pacific. Mag-invest kayo sa Pilipino.”

(“I want to use this moment to reaffirm a core truth to the international business community: the Philippines is not merely ready — we are a reliable, forward-looking partner in the Asia-Pacific. Invest in the Filipino.”)

Kasabay ng panawagan ni Marcos sa mga dayuhang negosyante, marami namang netizen ang nagpahayag ng agam-agam, sinasabing dapat munang linisin ng gobyerno ang mga isyung bumabalot sa korapsyon bago humingi ng tiwala mula sa mga banyagang investor.

"Novice Senator and manipulator, Rodante “Rule-Bender” Marcoleta, strikes again.

Prior to the initial suspension of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee investigation on flood control and related projects, the self-proclaimed defender of truth paraded a so-called “surprise witness,” Mr. Guteza— a man whose “Sinumpaang Salaysay” has now been judicially determined as fraudulent and perjured.

Under the long-established Senate Rules of Procedure Governing Inquiries in Aid of Legislation, no witness may be presented without prior notice to and coordination with the Committee Chair. But of course, Marcoleta, in his infinite arrogance, thought he could play both chairman and judge in one breath. He bypassed the Blue Ribbon Commitee protocols, blindsiding everyone with his grand theatrics, the kind that collapses under the weight of the truth.

And when confronted, he doubled down on national television, vouching for Guteza’s credibility, even calling the perjured affidavit “high-class”— perhaps referring to the class of lies it contained. He proclaimed Guteza had no motive, which now looks painfully ironic, given the court’s finding that the affidavit was a work of falsifcation.

The irony? The same Marcoleta who once railed against Senator Ping Lacson, now the reinstated Chairman of the Blue Ribbon Committee, for “bias” and “unfairness,” has himself been caught manipulating the course of the investigation, lawyering for the very people under scrutiny. It’s almost Shakespearean: “The villain doth protest too much.”

This isn’t just incompetence; it’s deliberate deceit. Under Article 183 of the Revised Penal Code, perjury is a punishable crime, and by Rule 21 of the Senate Rules, any act that impedes or obstructs an inquiry is contemptuous. Marcoleta’s circus act managed to achieve both.

The man who preached “integrity” before the cameras has now been unmasked as the novice manipulator that he is— an unprincpled partisan, weaponising procedure and deceit to protect his allies and mislead the public.

In the court of public opinion, Mr. Marcoleta, your credibility, like Guteza’s affidavit, stands utterly falsified.",Neutral

DEFENSOR: ROMUALDEZ AT CO, NASA LIKOD NG PANINIRA KAY GUTEZA

Inakusahan ni dating Anakalusugan Rep. Mike Defensor sina Leyte Rep. Martin Romualdez at resigned Ako Bicol Rep. Zaldy Co na nasa likod umano ng tangkang pagpapabagsak sa kredibilidad ni Orly Guteza, ang ex- Marine na naging testigo sa Senate Blue Ribbon Committee hinggil sa multibillion-peso flood control scandal.

Bagaman idineklara ng Manila RTC Branch 18 na peke ang affidavit ni Guteza, nanindigan si Defensor na maaaring pinilit o pinresyur ang abogadang si Petchie Rose Espera upang sabihing hindi siya ang nag-notaryo sa dokumento.

“Ang interes ko dyan is to know who is behind the pressure doon sa notaryo to make (her) say na it’s fake. To make them claim in the court na peke ‘to kasi di ba it’s a way to discredit Sgt. Guteza. Bakit mo gagawin yung ganun?”

Giit pa ni Defensor, kung may mali man sa notary details, naresolba na ito nang personal na humarap sa Senado si Guteza at muling nanumpa sa ilalim ng batas.

“Kung anuman yung mga pagkakamali dun sa notaryo, yun naman ay nagamot na ng si Guteza ay nagpunta ng Senado at nagkaroon ng under oath statement,” sabi ni Defensor.

Nang tanungin kung sino ang nasa likod ng umano’y smear campaign laban kay Guteza, diretsahang sagot ni Defensor:

“Well of course, si Cong. Zaldy Co. I’m sorry kaibigan ko siya pero ito para sa bansa ‘to… at syempre si Speaker Martin Romualdez.”

Si Defensor ang nagpakilala kay Guteza kay Sen. Rodante Marcoleta, na siyang nagprisinta rito bilang surprise witness sa pagdinig ng Senate Blue Ribbon Committee na pinamumunuan ni Senate President Pro Tempore Ping Lacson.

Sa nasabing pagdinig, ibinulgar ni Guteza na personal umano niyang naghatid ng maletang naglalaman ng tig-₱48 milyon sa mga tirahan nina Co at Romualdez — bagay na itinanggi ng dalawang kongresista.

Una rito, sinabi ng CAAP na nakalipad na sa Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia ang dalawang AgustaWestland helicopters ni Co noong August 20 at September 11; habang ang isang Gulfstream aircraft ni Co ay nasa Singapore na noon pang August 16.

"Mariing pinabulanaan ng Philippine Navy ngayong Huwebes, Oktubre 30, ang pahayag ni dating Congressman Michael Defensor na nasa kustodiya ng Philippine Marines ang dating miyembro nito na si Orly Regala Guteza, na tumestigo sa Senate Blue Ribbon Committee ilang araw na ang nakararaan.

“It must be also made clear that Mr. Orly Regala Guteza is not under the protection of the Philippine Marine Corps, which has no involvement in his personal affairs,” nakasaad sa statement ni Navy spokesperson Capt. Marissa Martinez.

Matatandaan na sinabi ni Guteza sa pagdinig ng Senate panel sa flood control scam na siya mismo ang naghahatid ng male-maletang salapi sa bahay ni dating Speaker Martin Romualdez bilang komisyon ng mambabatas sa ‘ghost’ flood control projects na pinabulaanan ng kongresista mula sa Unang Distrito ng Leyte.

Bagamat sumablay diumano si Guteza sa kanyang binasang sworn statement na lumitaw na pineke ang notaryo, nais ni Senate President Pro Tempore Panfilo ‘Ping’ Lacson na muling ipatawag ang dating sundalo ng Philippine Marines upang ihayag ang kanyang mga nalalaman sa flood control scam.

Si Guteza ay ibinitbit ni Sen. Rodante Marcoleta sa Senate Blue Ribbon Committee hearing bilang “surprise witness” subalit ilang ulit itong nagkalat sa kanyang mga testimonya na mismong ang senador ang nakapuna.
Samantala, si dating Quezon City congressman Mike Defensor ang itinuturong ""handler"" ni Guteza nang ito ay humarap sa Senate investigation.

Itinuring na “moot and academic” ang plunder cases matapos siyang ma-acquit ng Sandiganbayan noong Enero 19, 2024.

Tinanggihan rin ng Korte ang argumento na ang graft charges ay nasasaklaw ng plunder, kaya puwede pa rin siyang kasuhan nang hiwalay sa RA 3019 o Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.

"MANSION NI ZALDYCO KUMPIRMADONG GINAWANG “MONEY VAULT”?

Ibinunyag sa Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) na ang mansion ni dating Ako Bicol Rep. Elizaldy “Zaldy” Co sa Valle Verde 6, Pasig City, ay ginamit bilang imbakan ng salapi mula umano sa mga proyekto ng gobyerno.

Ayon kay Brice Hernandez, dating DPWH Assistant District Engineer ng Bulacan, mula 2023 hanggang 2025, sunod-sunod ang mga cash deliveries sa bahay ni Co sa Ladybug Street. Bawat biyahe ay pitong sasakyan ang gamit, at ang bawat malaking bagahe ay may ₱50 milyon, habang ang mas maliit ay may ₱30–₱40 milyon.

“Nadiskubre niya na eksklusibong ginagamit ang bahay para sa imbakan ng cash deliveries kay Cong. Co, dahil walang kasangkapan sa loob — puro bagahe lamang mula sa iba’t ibang pinagmulan.” 

(“This was also the instance where he discovered that the said house was exclusively used as a storage of the cash deliveries made to Cong. Co, as there was no furniture inside—only pieces of luggage coming from different sources.”)

Bukod dito, tumatanggap din umano ng pera si Co sa penthouse niya sa The Shangri-La at The Fort, BGC, kung saan ang kanyang chief of staff na si Paul Estrada ang tumatanggap ng mga maleta sa basement ng gusali.

Ang pahayag ni Hernandez ay dumugtong sa naunang testimonya noong nakaraang buwan ng dating aide ni Co na si Orly Guteza, na nagbukas ng pinto sa malawakang alegasyon ng kickback at “cash drops” sa mga opisyal ng gobyerno.

Sa pagharap ni Guteza sa Senate Blue Ribbon Committee noong Setyembre 2025, direkta niyang sinabi:

“Yung palang pera na binubuhat namin at dine-deliver ay mula sa masamang gawain na nagdulot ng baha, na ikinamatay ng tao, at imbes na gamitin ang pera sa edukasyon at medikal na programa, ay napunta pala sa mga bulsa ng mga pulitiko.”

Ibinunyag ni Guteza na dalawa hanggang tatlong beses kada linggo ang tinatawag nilang “basura” drop, kung saan bawat maleta ay naglalaman ng ₱48 milyon.

“Tagabuhat lang ako ng maleta ng ‘basura.’ Ang ibig sabihin ng basura ay maleta na may lamang pera. Ang bawat maleta ay may lamang humigit kumulang ₱48 million.”

Dagdag pa niya, may mga drop-off sa tirahan ni Romualdez, sa Aguado sa loob ng Malacañang compound, at sa mga bahay ni Co sa Pasig at Taguig.

Si Co, na dating House Appropriations Committee chairman, ay tinukoy sa ulat ng ICI bilang responsable sa ₱35 bilyong halaga ng mga proyekto sa Bulacan mula 2022 hanggang 2025. Nagbitiw siya bilang kongresista noong Setyembre 2025, sa gitna ng lumalaking iskandalo.

"So who will fry and who will fly? A couple have already flown the coop. Zaldy Co for one. Dong Gonzales has been quiet as with the rest of the coterie of sycophants who surrounded them at the height of their power since 2022. 

The ICI has released a list of those to be charged initially but there are some missing personalities who were mentioned by resource persons at the blue ribbon committee hearings. This makes you wonder, is the evidence based on documents or merely the day so of the DPWH officials involved. 

One can't help but feel that the investigation won't get anywhere. The Napoles scam started out with a long list of lawmakers but ended up with a chose few being arrested, mostly political enemies of the then administration. 

It looks to be the same with this scandal. The former senator who's fixated with the Duterte's has filed cases at the Ombudsman and has even gone to the extent of spreading the fake news that Bong Go has been invited to the ICI, which was later denied by the executive director of the body. 

What will happen next is anyone's guess. The passport of Co hasn't been canceled. The net covering the complicit hasn't been cast wide enough.

Those who are familiar with how government works understand that the anomalies couldn't have been committed without the participation of elected and appointed officials in key agencies where the funds originate. 

We've all seen how past scandals were investigated and the alleged guilty parties arrested and charged only for them to get away scot-free. 

It's wishful thinking and plain stupidity to think that this won't be repeated in this case again.

The Filipino people demand that this administration stop the evasions and act decisively to bring Zaldy Co back to the country to face due process. No official, no matter how wealthy or well-connected, should be allowed to mock the rule of law by hiding abroad while investigations pile up at home.

The mechanisms already exist. The government must move, now.
1.Locate and Verify. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) must disclose where Zaldy Co currently resides and under what status. The people have a right to know.
2.Activate the Treaties. If he is in a country with an extradition or mutual legal assistance treaty with the Philippines, the DOJ must immediately file the formal request for extradition, invoking the country’s obligations under international law.
3.Invoke the New Supreme Court Rules. The administration must fully enforce A.M. No. 22-03-29-SC, which streamlines extradition and allows Interpol Red Notices to serve as valid triggers for provisional arrest. These rules were made precisely to prevent fugitives like him from manipulating legal delays.
4.Suspend His Passport. The DFA must revoke his Philippine passport, stripping him of the privilege to remain abroad and forcing his host country to act.
5.Coordinate with Interpol. The PNP and NBI must request and publicize an Interpol Red Notice to make his status visible and actionable worldwide.
6.Use Diplomatic Pressure. If no treaty exists, the DFA must pursue deportation on immigration grounds or invoke bilateral cooperation to have him returned.
7.Assure Due Process. The government must guarantee that, upon his return, Zaldy Co will face trial in the Philippine courts, with full due process, but without privilege or protection.

This is not just about one man. This is about restoring the moral authority of the state. Every day that fugitives like Co remain free abroad, public faith in our institutions erodes further. The law must be enforced without fear or favor.

The Filipino people demand action, transparency, and results, not excuses.

"LEGARDA TO DPWH: REVIEW AND REALLOCATE SAVINGS FROM QUESTIONABLE 2025 PROJECTS TO EDUCATION

Sen. Loren Legarda has urged the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to conduct a thorough review of questionable infrastructure projects under the proposed 2025 national budget, emphasizing that potential savings from overpriced or poorly implemented projects should be redirected to critical social infrastructure—particularly education.

During the continuation of the Senate Committee on Finance hearing on the DPWH's 2025 budget proposal, Legarda flagged projects amounting to nearly ₱1 trillion that may still reflect outdated or inflated cost estimates.

""Another source of savings, if I may, would be questionable 2025 projects,"" Legarda said. ""I believe there is still 1 trillion worth in projects being implemented. So what do you do with those already being implemented but based on the cost of materials alam niyo na na-overpriced? Dapat mag-renegotiate, at dapat ay ibaba iyong presyo maski may kontrata dahil puwede naman iyan, may mga provisions naman sa New Government Procurement Act. Hindi tayo dapat patuloy na magpaloko sa mga nag-o-overprice. Things will not simply straighten out on their own by 2026 if we allow ₱1 trillion worth of projects to remain overpriced.""

DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon acknowledged Legarda's concerns and assured senators that the department has begun adjusting project costs to reflect current, lower material prices.

""For 2025, for those that have not yet been procured, we will apply already the new cost of materials,"" Dizon said. ""For those that have already been awarded and are already ongoing. We will consult on papaano natin mahahabol, if kaya, iyong mga ongoing na at awarded na, but for those na hindi pa, definitely po we will apply the new cost already, we will not wait for 2026, we will apply the new cost already now.""

Legarda also requested a district-level breakdown of projects that can be renegotiated or terminated, in line with President Ferdinad Marcos Jr.'s directive to lower the Detailed Unit Price Analysis (DUPA).

""May we receive from the engineering districts a list of projects not yet implemented that can generate savings from renegotiated contracts based on the President's advisory on lowering the DUPA? Second, for ongoing projects na alam niyong overpriced naman at niloloko tayo, bago pa makapasok ang bagong team, maaari niyo namang i-terminate ang mga ito — nagawa niyo na rin naman ito sa ibang distrito, 'di ba?,"" she said.

The four-term senator emphasized that the DPWH has both the authority and responsibility to pursue contract renegotiations or terminations where warranted.

""So the DPWH can actually do a sweep of these projects ongoing for 2025, terminate those that it can terminate, or renegotiate for a lower price based on the President's advisory for a lower DUPA, so that we can generate more savings,"" Legarda added.

Dizon confirmed that the DPWH has already taken action against erring contractors.

""Yes, in fact, we have terminated already based on the cases that have been filed as well as the licenses that have been cancelled,"" Dizon said. ""We have terminated several already, particularly all the contracts of the Discaya companies as well as their joint venture partners, as well as the other companies where we have filed, companies such as Wawao, SYMS. We will consult with the Office of the Solicitor General, and we will see papaano natin mahahabol ito.""

As Chairperson of the Senate Committee on Higher, Technical, and Vocational Education, Legarda stressed that potential savings should be redirected to the construction of classrooms and school facilities.

""Iyong savings na sinabi po ni Chair kanina, na gusto niya ngayon na-i-allocate, huwag na pag-antayin ang mga tao, iyong kay Presidente pa lang, 45 o 50 billion na iyon, assuming lang sa classrooms,"" Legarda said.

""I would assume, 'pag classroom, hindi naman siguro madadaya, hindi naman siguro ma-ghost, hindi naman siguro subject to anomang anomalya o korapsyon, at magiginhawaan ang ating sektor ng basic education. Sang-ayon ako sa sinabi ng Chair na iyong kaya nang ma-save ngayon, i-re-allocate na natin sa ibang imprastraktura, at ang aming bias ay edukasyon, para sa school building,"" she added.",Neutral

"Statement on the PBBM Order to return 60 B to Philhealth and Department of Finance’s Attempt to Rewrite History

Dr. Tony Leachon
Independent Health Reform Advocate
September 20, 2025

The Department of Finance’s statement welcoming the return of ₱60 billion to PhilHealth is not a triumph—it is a belated admission of guilt.

Let us not forget: it was Secretary Ralph Recto who initiated and defended the transfer of these funds, despite strong resistance from civil society, health advocates, and legal experts. Secretary Ted Herbosa, meanwhile, stood by silently as the health system was defunded—failing to defend the very institution he was entrusted to lead. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) approved a 2025 budget with zero subsidy for PhilHealth, while billions in questionable insertions passed without scrutiny.

Now, with public outrage mounting, the DOF is attempting to wash its hands of responsibility—like a modern-day Pontius Pilate. This is gaslighting at the highest level.

The DOF claims it gave a “solicited opinion” to support fund augmentation. But where was that opinion when the funds were first diverted? Where was that support when patients were turned away, when benefits were cut, when the Universal Health Care law was violated?

Let’s be clear: it was the DOF that pressured government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) to surrender their reserves. And PhilHealth wasn’t the only victim. The Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) was forced to remit over ₱107 billion to the national treasury—justified as “unrestricted funds” for infrastructure and social programs. If the DOF is truly sincere, it should return those funds too.

We must also confront the truth behind the so-called “DPWH savings.” The ₱60 billion is said to be sourced from these savings—but that doesn’t mean the health funds ended up in DPWH. It means they were absorbed into a system where accountability is blurred and priorities are misplaced.

So where is the condemnation?
Where is the accountability?
Has justice been served?

Secretary Recto must resign. Secretary Herbosa must explain his silence. And the DBM must answer for its role in enabling this injustice.

To President Marcos: this is a moment of reckoning. We believe you were misled by those around you—by officials who prioritized political convenience over public welfare. But now, you have chosen to act. That act deserves recognition. It also demands follow-through.

The restoration of funds is a welcome development. But let us be honest: the proposed 2026 PhilHealth budget is still grossly inadequate. It has been slashed, trimmed, and manipulated—kinupitan. This is not reform. This is repetition. And it proves why a Supreme Court decision is still urgently needed.

We need the Court to speak—not just to correct the past, but to protect the future. Without a ruling, the petition risks being declared moot—setting a dangerous precedent for future abuse.

If the Court affirms that the ₱60 billion transfer was unconstitutional, then how much more indefensible is the zero subsidy for PhilHealth in the 2025 budget? That is not just a fiscal error—it is a moral failure.

The Supreme Court’s decision will be more than symbolic. It will guide Congress in reallocating funds from bloated infrastructure projects to health and education. It will restore the moral compass of public finance.

This is not just about numbers. It is about lives.

The President’s move is a defensive gambit—a face-saving measure at a time when other forms of plunder are angering the public in other arenas. But if this is the beginning of change, then let it be real. Let it be bold. Let it be just.

We stand firm in our call for truth, justice, and reform. We will not be gaslit into silence. 

And we will not stop until every Filipino receives the health care, dignity, and accountability they deserve.

Give what is rightfully owed to the people—according to law.
Now.

In a fiery online video message uploaded Wednesday (October 29), the former Ilocos Sur governor said the President cannot deny accountability for the questionable insertions made by lawmakers in the proposed ₱6.3-trillion 2025 national budget, as he ultimately signed it into law.

"LACSON: WHY DID EX-DPWH CHIEF BONOAN TAKE PROJECT 'MEMOS' FROM 'OUTSIDERS'?

Senate President Pro Tempore Ping Lacson has questioned why former Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Secretary Manuel Bonoan allegedly received handwritten ""memos"" from civilians or non-DPWH personnel endorsing projects for approval.

""Nagtataka ako. May nakita akong dokumento, nagme-memo kay Sec. Bonoan. Nang pina-check ko ang pangalan, kasi naka-indicate lang doon initials, so hanap kami ng hanap. Hindi namin makita sa loob ng departamento... Paano sila nagme-memo sa Secretary ng DPWH? Parang Post-It, handwritten naka-Post-It na may ineendorsong proyekto,"" Lacson said during a DZBB interview.

Lacson noted that such communications bypassed official channels, describing them as ""highly irregular."" The revelation surfaced as the Senate continues to investigate alleged corruption behind anomalous flood control and other infrastructure projects.

The senator earlier flagged the DPWH's so-called ""leadership fund,"" which Bonoan said consolidated lawmakers' proposals into the National Expenditure Program — effectively allowing them to modify the budget before formal authorization. Lacson reminded Bonoan that the budget process follows four stages: preparation, authorization, execution, and accountability.

He also criticized the department for arbitrarily altering lawmakers' requests, citing instances where multipurpose building projects worth ₱1.5 billion were replaced by ₱600 million in flood control projects — indicating that kickbacks had taken precedence over actual needs.

""Ang nangyayari ayon sa narinig naming testimony ng taga-DPWH, parang laruan sa kanila ang pondo ng bayan,"" Lacson said, adding that the system has encouraged contractor-driven and substandard projects.

Lacson said the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee's probe on flood control projects could expand to other infrastructure programs, such as farm-to-market roads, citing how corruption has gone ""undetected or unpunished"" over time.

The panel is set to hold its next hearing on November 14, with at least one ""very important witness"" expected to appear. Lacson also announced plans to subpoena retired T/Sgt. Orly Guteza, who previously claimed he delivered suitcases of cash to the homes of former House Speaker Martin Romualdez and ex-Ako Bicol Party-list Rep. Elizaldy Co — an allegation both parties have denied.

Lacson said Guteza was seen on Senate CCTV visiting the office of Senate Deputy Minority Leader Rodante Marcoleta before attending the previous hearing. The Blue Ribbon panel will also summon the contractor allegedly building Romualdez's residence to verify Guteza's claims.

He added that while Guteza's statement before the committee remains valid, a Manila court's finding of inconsistencies in his notarized affidavit signature could undermine his credibility.",Neutral

JUST IN: The Supreme Court denied Senator Jinggoy Estrada’s petition for review that sought the dismissal of his graft cases related to the pork barrel scam, where the senator cited his earlier acquittal on plunder charges before the Sandiganbayan.

The court said the absorption principle - where one offense merges into another - does not apply between graft and plunder, except in rare cases where the same public officer is both the giver and the recipient of the unwarranted benefit.

“The Decision effectively affirms that violations of Republic Act No. 3019 may be prosecuted separately from plunder,” the Supreme Court’s briefer stated, referring to thew Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.

"Estrada Beats Plunder Rap, But Graft Still Sticks

The Supreme Court’s latest ruling is a reminder that in Philippine politics, acquittal on one charge is not absolution from all. Jinggoy Estrada may have escaped the heavy label of “plunderer” after the Sandiganbayan cleared him in January, but the graft cases tied to his pork barrel dealings remain alive.

Estrada tried to argue that graft was just a subset of plunder, hoping one verdict would wash away the rest. The Court wasn’t buying it. Plunder is about fattening your own pockets. Graft is about greasing the palms of others. Two different crimes, two different betrayals of public trust.

The amounts involved aren’t loose change: ₱183.7 million in alleged kickbacks on one hand, ₱255.1 million in questionable PDAF disbursements on the other. That’s money that should have built classrooms or hospitals, not bank accounts and bogus NGOs.

This ruling exposes a deeper truth: political dynasties love the narrative of vindication, but “not guilty of plunder” doesn’t mean “innocent of graft.” The stain remains. And the lesson for the public? Watch how the system bends — it rarely snaps — when the powerful are on trial.

Aniya, mandato ito ng komisyon at sa nagdaang dalawang buwan ay marami na silang kinitang mga tao at inimbestigahan kaugnay sa flood control scam.

Nang tanungin kung ano ang susunod na mangyayari, sinabi ni Remulla na posibleng sundan ito ng preliminary investigation: “some validation of some information, but basically many of them are ripe… for action already.”

“Most of the fact-finding have been done by the ICI, or sometimes the fact-finding was done by the DOJ… which makes the facts already vetted or validated already,” dagdag pa niya sa press briefing ngayong Miyerkules, Oktubre 29.

Sa interim report ng Independent Commission for Infrastructure sa Ombudsman, personal umanong dinala ni dating DPWH Engineer Henry Alcantara ang P150M kickback sa bahay ni Villanueva sa Bocaue, Bulacan.

Sa testimonya ni Alcantara, ibinigay umano niya ang pera sa isang ‘Peng’ na aide ng senador pero ayon kina dating DPWH Engineers Brice Hernandez at Jaypee Mendoza, ito mismo ang nag-abot ng kickback kay Villanueva. 

Sinabi pa ni Alcantara na noong 2022, humingi si Villanueva ng P1.5B para sa isang multi-purpose building kahit P600M lang ang pinapayagan.

“The alleged participation appears to constitute violations of Article 210 to 212 of the Revised Penal Code on bribery and corruption of public officers.

“We don’t want the ICI to be fast but fail,” giit ni Ridon sa ginanap na press conference ngayong Miyerkules, Oktubre 29.

Kabilang sa bagong batch na sinampahan ng kasong kriminal sa Office of the Ombudsman ay sina Senators Jinggoy Estrada at Joel Villanueva, dating Congressman Zaldy Co, dating Congresswoman Mitch Cajayon-Uy, dating Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) undersecretary Roberto Bernardo,  at Commission on Audit (COA) Commissioner Mario Lipana.

Ang anim ay nahaharap sa mga kasong direct or indirect bribery, corruption of public officials, at plunder.

Ibinandera ni ICI Chairman retired Justice Andres Reyes Jr. na makalipas ng 48 araw nang itatag ang komisyon, mayroon nang mga nakasuhan hinggil sa flood control scam.

Ginawang ehemplo ni Ridon ang kontrobersiya sa Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), kung saan nakasuhan din sina Estrada at Villanueva, na inabot ng mahigit 10 buwan bago nagsampa ng kaso sa Sandiganbayan.

“Katulad ng PDAF scam. Marami pong na-involve po dito. But it is very important na naka-focus tayo sa mga pinakamalalaking usapin,” giit ni Ridon.

"In her first episode as a PGMN anchor, @149899847293623 examined how the ₱1.7-trillion stock market crash in October 2025 — triggered by the flood-control corruption scandal — wiped out massive value from the Philippine Stock Exchange. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission (@52965565833670), the sharp downturn was driven by corruption concerns that eroded investor confidence and sparked widespread sell-offs across sectors, marking one of the market’s steepest declines in recent years.

Aquino began by explaining that while many Filipinos dismiss the stock market as something only the wealthy should worry about, it serves as the pulse of national confidence. A strong market, she said, signals growth, business expansion, and job creation. But when that confidence collapses, the damage spreads quickly — affecting everything from the value of the peso to the price of basic goods.

Watch the full episode here: 
https://t.co/jSKyv1bmfm

The episode examined how billions of pesos meant for public infrastructure were reportedly funneled into ghost projects and overpricing schemes, eroding investor trust and prompting widespread panic in the financial sector. Aquino said that this loss of confidence — not poor corporate performance — was the main reason behind the sharp decline.

She detailed how the effects rippled across social classes. For high-income earners, the crash meant steep portfolio losses and declining business valuations. The middle class, on the other hand, experienced smaller bonuses, delayed promotions, and rising prices. Meanwhile, low-income Filipinos felt the immediate impact of inflation — higher transportation fares, costlier electricity bills, and more expensive groceries.

Aquino explained that these effects compound as government revenues shrink during downturns. With fewer taxes collected, the state’s capacity to deliver basic services weakens. “Pag humina ang negosyo, mas konti ang taxes na nakokolekta ng gobyerno. Kaya kumokonti ang pera para sa ospital, paaralan, at mga tulong sa mahihirap,” she said.

She added that when funding runs short, public hospitals face shortages, schools lose scholarship programs, and local aid becomes harder to sustain — leaving millions of families more vulnerable.

Throughout the episode, Aquino emphasized that corruption in government spending has real-world consequences that go far beyond the headlines. She said it limits opportunities for growth, squeezes ordinary families, and diminishes the country’s capacity to recover.

Her most striking statement came near the end: “Ang stock market, mukhang para lang sa mayayaman. Pero kapag bumagsak ‘yan, walang exempted.”

Aquino closed by reminding viewers that every Filipino — regardless of income or status — is connected to the country’s economic heartbeat. When corruption breaks public trust, she said, the shockwaves reach everyone.",Positive

"BREAKING: ICI recommends plunder, graft raps vs Sen. Villanueva, Estrada, Zaldy Co, etal

The Independent Commission for Infrastructure has recommended criminal and administrative charges against several high-ranking officials, following the testimony of Henry Alcantara, a former DPWH district engineer in Bulacan.

Alcantara revealed how lawmakers allegedly coordinated with him to funnel infrastructure budgets into flood control projects—where kickbacks reportedly reached 25–30%, far higher than the usual 10% from other contracts.

Officials named in the report: 
• Senator Joel Villanueva 
• Senator Jinggoy Estrada 
• Former Representative Zaldy Co 
• Former Representative Mitch Cajayon Uy 
• Former Public Works Undersecretary Roberto Bernardo 
• COA Commissioner Mario Lipana

The scheme allegedly involved inserting projects into the National Expenditure Program (NEP) or the General Appropriations Act (GAA) through bicameral insertions, with bribes exchanged for project approvals and budget allocations.

Possible violations include plunder, bribery, and corruption of public officials under the Revised Penal Code and Republic Act 3019.

This is a developing story.

"Kinumpirma ng Manila Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 18 na peke ang affidavit na iniharap sa Senate Blue Ribbon Committee ni Orly Guteza, dating bodyguard ni Elizaldy ""Zaldy"" Co.

Sa isang 11-pahinang desisyon ni Executive Judge Carolina Icasiano-Sison, napatunayang peke ang pirma ng notary public na si Atty. Petchie Rose Espera matapos lumabas sa forensic examination na may malaking pagkakaiba sa kaniyang tunay na lagda.

Itinanggi rin ni Espera na siya ang nag-notarize ng dokumento at tinawag itong mapanlinlang at nakasisira sa kaniyang reputasyon.

Inatasan ng korte ang Department of Justice (DOJ) na magsampa ng falsification case laban kay Guteza at sa mga gumamit ng naturang dokumento.

"‘THEY WON’T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT’

Ito ang pahayag ni Ombudsman Jesus Crispin ‘Boying’ Remulla hinggil sa posibilidad na pinoprotektahan ng mag-asawang kontratista na sina Curlee at Sarah Discaya si Sen. Christopher Lawrence ‘Bong’ Go kaugnay sa joint ventures ng mga ito sa CLTG Builders, na pag-aari ng pamilya ng senador.

“Probably, siya (Sen. Bong Go) ang nagbigay ng break sa kanila,” sabi ni Ombudsman Remulla, nang tanungin kung bakit posibleng pinoprotektahan ng mag-asawang Discaya ang senador.

“Dahil nung (nag-joint venture) sila sa CLTG, nagtuloy-tuloy silang nakialam na sa buong Pilipinas. Tuloy-tuloy ‘yung gameplan nila na mas marami silang nakuhang kontrata,” dagdag niya.

Matatandaang inamin mismo ni Sarah Discaya na nagkaroon ng joint venture noong 2017 ang isa sa mga kumpanya nila, ang St. Gerrard Construction, sa CLTG Builders ni Deciderio Go, ama ni Sen. Go.

"Matapos ang 48 araw nang itatag ang Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI), napagtagpi-tagpi na rin ni ICI Chairman retired Justice Andres Reyes Jr. ang ‘modus’ ng mga idinawit sa multi-bilyong pisong anomalya sa flood control projects, kabilang sina Senators Jinggoy Estrada at Joel Villanueva.

Dahil dito, inirekomenda ng ICI sa Office of the Ombudsman na sampahan ng mga kasong kriminal at administratibo ang dalawang senador at apat na iba pa na kinabibilangan nina dating Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) undersecretary Roberto Bernardo, dating Congressman Zaldy Co, Commission on Audit (COA) Commissioner Mario Lipana, at dating Congresswoman Mitch Cajayon-Uy.

“The testimonies and affidavits named the above-mentioned government officials or former government officials as primarily involved in these violations,” saad ni Reyes sa ginanap na press conference ngayong Miyerkules, Oktubre 29.

Ayon kay Andres, nagsisimula ang anomalya sa mga “proponent” ng flood control project na miyembro ng Kamara o Senado. Ang mga mambabatas na umaaktong proponent ang siya namang magsasabi kay dating DPWH Bulacan district engineer Henry Alcantara na mayroon nang inalaang pondo para sa infrastructure project.

Sinabi ng ICI chairman na mas pinapaboran ng mga proponent ang flood control projects kumpara sa ibang proyektong imprastraktura dahil sa una ay mayroong 25 hanggang 30 porsiyentong kickback kumpara sa iba na kukubra lamang sila ng 10 porsiyento.

Pagkatapos nito ay gagawa si Alcantara ng listahan ng mga proyekto base sa budget na inilaan ng mga proponent. “The list is given to Juan Carlo Rivera who would then transmit it to either the regional office in Bulacan or to the proponent itself.”

Kapag ang listahan ay ibinigay na sa DPWH director, ito ay isisingit na sa National Expenditure Program (NEP), ayon sa ICI chairman.

“On the other hand, if the list is given to the proponent itself, he or she would insert the projects in the House General Appropriations Bill or bicameral insertions wherein it would be reflected in the General Appropriations Act (GAA),” dagdag ni Reyes.

At kapag lumitaw na ang proyekto sa NEP o GAA, maghahanda na si Rivera ng summary ng mga proyekto habang si Alcantara naman ay pipili na ng kontratista na magpapatupad ng proyekto.

“This would trigger the payment on obligations or SOP to the proponent,” ani Reyes.

Ibibigay rin ang 10 porsiyentong advance payment mula sa budget allocation kapag inilabas na ang NEP habang ang natitirang 15 porsiyento ay ibabayad sa proponent kapag naipasa na ang GAA, inihayag din ni Reyes.

Matatandaan na sina Estrada at Villanueva ay sinampahan din ng mga kasong kriminal matapos idawit sa multi-bilyong pisong anomalya sa Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), na mas kilala bilang “pork barrel fund,” noong termino ng yumaong Pangulong Benigno Simeon ‘Noynoy’ Aquino III.

"GROSS NEGLIGENCE, HINDI PLUNDER – REMULLA

Ipinaliwanag ni Ombudsman Boying Remulla na maaaring managot si dating House Speaker at Leyte 1st District Rep. Martin Romualdez sa kasong gross negligence, kung walang matibay na ebidensiya para sa kasong plunder kaugnay ng mga iregularidad sa flood control projects.

Ayon kay Remulla:

“Ang isang pwedeng theory ay gross negligence. Speaker of the House siya [Martin Romualdez] at siya ang pumili ng chairman ng appropriations committee. Kahit di siya nag-participate dapat inalam niya rin kung anong nangyayari sa pondo ng bayan.”

Sa ilalim ng Revised Penal Code, ang gross negligence ay may parusang mula arresto mayor hanggang prision correccional, depende sa bigat ng kasong resulta kung ito’y sinadya.

Ang pahayag ni Remulla ay kasunod ng mga tanong kung dapat bang papanagutin si Romualdez sa mga iregularidad na lumitaw sa imbestigasyon ng Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) hinggil sa mga “ghost flood control projects” na pinondohan ng bilyon-bilyong piso ng bayan.

Base raw ito sa mga testimonya ng ilang testigo na humarap sa ICI sa gitna ng imbestigasyon sa mga maanomalyang proyekto ng Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).

"Amid the growing spotlight on bribery and “gift-giving” in flood control scandals, local governments that have enforced strict no-gift rules are drawing renewed public respect for showing that ethical governance can start at the local level.

Naga City is at the center of this renewed push. Former Vice President and now Mayor @431221529830437 issued Executive Order No. 58 on October 22, institutionalizing a Comprehensive No Gift Policy that applies to all officials and employees of the city government. The order bans the direct or indirect solicitation or acceptance of any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, discount, service, or anything of monetary value connected to official functions.

The EO also bars indirect acceptance through family members, close friends, housemates, agents, or any person acting on behalf of the official. It identifies high-risk areas where strict adherence is crucial: procurement and contract management, permitting and licensing, inspections and enforcement, recruitment and promotions, and financial transactions. Gifts from regulated entities—those applying for or holding permits, licenses, or contracts with the city—are explicitly prohibited, including sponsored travel or entertainment.

While broad in scope, the EO allows strictly limited exceptions such as unsolicited tokens of nominal value, gifts from close family given purely out of personal affection, and protocolary gifts exchanged during official functions, provided they are recorded. Institutional donations are only allowed if made through formal agreements and subject to public disclosure.

A reporting and disposition mechanism is built into the policy. Any gift that exceeds nominal value or falls outside the exceptions must be reported to the Accountability Review Committee (ARC) within five working days. The ARC is tasked to document, register, and dispose of the gift appropriately. All offices are required to display “No Gift Policy” posters, include “No Gift Clauses” in contracts and bid documents, and actively inform the public of the prohibition.

Violations carry real consequences—administrative penalties such as reprimand, suspension, or dismissal, and potential criminal prosecution under Republic Acts 3019 and 6713 and other anti-graft laws.

Robredo explained, “The institutionalization of a comprehensive ‘No Gift Policy’ is a safeguard against conflicts of interest, corruption, and even the appearance of partiality or undue influence. Public office is a public trust, and we must always uphold that trust.”

In Kidapawan City, Mayor Jose Paolo Evangelista enforced a no-gift policy immediately upon assuming office, covering both city and barangay officials. “We are paid by the government; gifts and tips are not necessary to perform our tasks,” Evangelista said. His transparency drive includes livestreaming all procurement sessions through the city’s Bids and Awards Committee to allow real-time public monitoring of transactions.

Evangelista also banned the use of titles like “Honorable” for elected city officials, emphasizing that public service is a duty, not a status symbol. Likewise, the posting of names and photos of politicians on publicly funded projects has been prohibited. The city’s policy framework is designed to reduce opportunities for political patronage and to reinforce impartiality in government transactions. The administration’s governance reforms are closely tied to supporting farmers, fisherfolk, cooperatives, 4Ps beneficiaries, and other community sectors, making transparency a working principle rather than a slogan.

The tightening of rules is not limited to local cities like Naga and Kidapawan. Vice President @338895877931805 has the same policy in place in her office, continuing a strict no-gift stance she enforced even during her time as mayor of Davao City. This was confirmed by her ally, Senator @51465411046762, in a Facebook post highlighting her long-standing adherence to the rule. Padilla also noted that Duterte maintains this policy even when she is abroad, emphasizing that she does not accept gifts or favors in any form.

That governance approach is consistent with how Davao City has also led reforms to remove personal credit or branding from public service. It was one of the first LGUs to stop placing politicians’ names and faces on donations and relief goods during Sara Duterte’s mayoralty. The practice was recently reinforced through Executive Order No. 09, Series of 2025, signed on June 19 by Vice Mayor @339529628722889, stepping in for former President and Mayor @92917744756893. The EO orders the removal of all signages, billboards, and tarpaulins bearing the names or faces of officials on government projects and donations, aligning with DILG Memorandum Circular 2010-101. It further institutionalizes Davao’s long-time stance against using public service for personal or political promotion.

Sen. Padilla has publicly pointed to Sara Duterte’s strict adherence to these governance principles as an example of ethical leadership.

These local initiatives are firmly anchored on long-standing national laws meant to curb bribery and influence-peddling. Republic Act 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees requires all public servants to avoid accepting gifts, favors, or benefits that may influence their official actions. Republic Act 3019, the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, penalizes the act of receiving any consideration in connection with a government transaction. Presidential Decree 46 goes even further by prohibiting public officials from accepting gifts on any occasion, including holidays or celebrations, regardless of intent.

What sets Naga, Kidapawan, and Davao City apart is that they are applying these national laws through concrete local action—turning anti-graft provisions into day-to-day governance measures. By removing avenues for influence, cutting political branding, and institutionalizing accountability, these LGUs are closing the gray areas where bribery and corruption often thrive. If the same level of enforcement were applied at the national level, the systemic corruption exposed in flood control projects and other big-ticket programs would face far less space to operate.",Neutral

In June 2024, the Department of Public Works and Highways transmitted a routine memo: “Construction of Missile Storage Facility, Naval Base Rafael Ramos (NBRR), Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu,” a ₱10-million project under the DPWH–DND’s TIKAS program. On paper, it was just another defense line-item tucked inside the national budget. But when that phrase appeared on tarpaulins across Lapu-Lapu City, it became something else: a public announcement of a military weapons depot.

The Philippine Navy immediately reminded everyone of the stakes. In a carefully worded statement, it said that “sensitive facilities must remain confidential to ensure operational security.” That was less a rebuke, more a warning: publicity can make an installation a target.

Local leaders, however, struck a different tone. Mayor and Representative Cindi Chan defended the tarps, framing them as accountability to taxpayers. “If there were really security risks, the Navy would have told us,” she argued, adding that the city already hosts an air base and a naval base — why hide this one? For her, the tarp was transparent.

But this is where the logic falters. Bases are visible by design; a missile storage facility is not. Publicizing a weapons depot does not strengthen deterrence — it weakens it. The fact that the Navy raised OPSEC concerns shows that what might look like routine “tax transparency” on the ground is seen as strategic carelessness by the very institution meant to operate the facility.

And then there’s the politics. A ₱10-million allocation in a national defense budget is modest — likely meant for design or early construction. The money itself is not the scandal. The scandal is how it was used as political branding: “This is where your taxes go.” In doing so, a defense asset became a campaign prop. A line-item became a billboard. Governance blurred into self-promotion.

The larger question is not whether missile storage should be built — that’s a matter of defense strategy. The question is why it had to be paraded in public. When leaders confuse optics with stewardship, they don’t just risk their reputation; they risk the safety of their own constituents.

Transparency is essential in democracy, but in defense, silence is not secrecy — it is strategy. By advertising what should have been guarded, Lapu-Lapu’s leaders turned transparency into a liability. And in matters of national security, that is not just tone-deaf politics; it is reckless governance.

While the AFP will not take over project execution, it remains committed to assisting with supervision and oversight in areas like planning, bidding, costing, and inspection to ensure accountability and transparency in these crucial projects.

"Ibinunyag ni Senador Panfilo Lacson na tumanggap umano si dating Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Secretary Manuel Bonoan ng mga handwritten “memos” mula sa mga sibilyan o hindi empleyado ng kagawaran, na naglalaman ng mga proyektong dapat umanong aprubahan o iendorso.

Ayon kay Lacson, ang mga memo ay isinulat lamang sa Post-It notes at personal na natatanggap ni Bonoan, kahit hindi ito dumaan sa opisyal na proseso ng DPWH.

Ikinabahala rin ng senador kung bakit direktang nakikipag-ugnayan ang kalihim sa mga taong labas sa ahensya at kwinestiyon ang “leadership fund” na ginagamit umano sa pagproseso ng mga proyekto.

First off the tragic news today, blood has been shed once again in Basilan, this time in Tipo Tipo. I hope that violence there would be resolved soon. 

The Vico Sotto wannabee, Meow meow face Barzaga who is trying hard to be the version of a crusader for justice. He is being groomed by the DDS as the counterpart of the mayor of Pasig, a symbol of being untainted which is a farcry.  The latest katarantaduhan of this SOB is he said he would like to have the PCG defunded as he said it as being a waste of funds. I chose this in connection with the current crisis because you can connect the 2. The PCG is one of the most underfunded agencies as they lack equipment, training, gear, etc. The PCG is the one braving the WPS and always the first in line in the territorial dispute. Barzaga’s words speaks of treason against the motherland. Why do I tie the corruption issue? If a portion of the funds supposedly used in the Ghost projects was given to the PCG I believe it would’ve been a big help in terms of equipment and such. Bottomline besides corruption and ethica, Barzaga should be charged with treason!

Senator Lacson confirmed to OneNewsPH that the Executive judge of the Manila Regional Trial Court has completed the investigation into the alleged falsified notary of Guteza’s sworn statement, with the courts recommending that charges of falsification and pujury against Orly Guteza.

The Manila court has found the sworn statement of Senate witness Orly Guteza falsified, absolving notary public Petchie Rose Espera of any liability in the document’s notarization.

In an 11-page order dated Oct. 24, Executive Judge Carolina Iscasiano-Sison of the Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 18 said Espera appeared to be a “victim” of the falsification incident, as her signature and notarial details had been forged.

One of the basis for the executive judge’s ruling was a National Bureau of Investigation forensic analysis, which showed that the signature in Guteza’s sworn statement, compared with Espera’s standard signature, “were not written by one and the same person.”

"Jinggoy Estrada’s 2024 SALN: The Numbers Don’t Lie, But They Do Raise Questions

Another year, another glossy Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth from Senator Jinggoy Estrada. On paper, his fortune is impressive: over ₱252 million in assets stacked high with condos, houses, jewelry, vehicles, and nearly ₱100 million in “investments.” After subtracting liabilities of just ₱31 million, his net worth lands at a staggering ₱221 million.

But here’s the rub: for a lifelong politician, where does the sustained wealth come from? The math might be legal, but is it moral? Estrada’s long career has been shadowed by plunder charges, pork barrel scandals, and suspicions of political dynasties fattening themselves while ordinary Filipinos scrape by. When senators’ families can casually declare luxury condos, sprawling lots, and eight-figure cash holdings, what message does that send to citizens who line up at food banks or face ballooning utility bills?

The SALN is meant to assure transparency, not showcase excess. What we see here is less about “public service” and more about a dynasty’s private empire. While Estrada lists his half-brother JV Ejercito and his daughter Janelle Maria Ejercito as government officials, the family’s influence spreads far beyond kinship—it extends into the very fabric of policymaking.

Transparency should provoke accountability. Instead, these declarations read like a badge of untouchability. In a nation where minimum wage can’t keep up with rice prices, ₱221 million net worth isn’t just a number—it’s a mirror of the distance between our leaders and the people they claim to represent.

"DALIRI NI HEART, MAS MAYAMAN PA KAY CHIZ?

Sa inilabas na Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN) ni Senator Chiz Escudero para sa taong 2024, lumabas na mayroon lamang siyang kabuuang net worth na ₱18.84 milyon — kabilang na rito ang mga ari-arian, sasakyan, alahas, at cash sa bangko.

Ang nakakatuwang punto: ayon sa mga netizen, tila mas mahal pa ang singsing ni Heart Evangelista kaysa sa buong yaman ni Chiz. 😅

Kamakailan, pinag-usapan online ang Paraiba Tourmaline ring ni Heart — isang bihirang hiyas na sinasabing aabot sa ₱60 milyon o $1 milyon dolyar depende sa kalidad. Kahit pa binawi ng isang jewelry expert na “hindi ito ganun kamahal,” malinaw na lampas pa rin sa SALN ni Chiz ang halaga ng naturang singsing kung totoo ang tinatayang presyo.

Sa SALN ni Escudero, nakasaad na ang kanyang pinakamalaking asset ay ₱11.7 milyon cash, kasunod ng ilang vintage luxury cars at mga alahas na nagkakahalaga ng ₱4.9 milyon. Walang iniulat na utang o liability ang senador.

"LACSON: DPWH DIVERTED ₱50B IN UNPROGRAMMED FUNDS FOR INFRA PROJECTS IN 2024

Senate President Pro Tempore Ping Lacson revealed that the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) diverted no less than ₱50 billion from unprogrammed appropriations in the 2024 national budget for various infrastructure projects — including ₱30 billion for flood control alone.

""Sa 2024, nakita ko ang dokumento, ang hinugot nila from unprogrammed appropriations, pumapalo ng P50B at P30B ang nakalagak sa flood control projects,"" Lacson said during an interview on DZBB. ""Ibig sabihin nawili sila sa flood control projects na di tumatama sa master plan.""

He said the appropriations were spread across several districts, enabling collusion between some lawmakers and DPWH officials.

""Talagang naabuso. Kasi nandiyan ang suki nila, suki ng mambabatas sa DPWH kaya tinambakan nila kaya naungusan ang education sector. Kaya sa 2025 tinodo nila, yan ang masama kasi nawili, kaya sumabog,"" he added.

Lacson welcomed the reforms being implemented by new DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon to align projects with the government's master plan, as well as the stance of Senate Finance Committee Chair Win Gatchalian not to fund projects outside it.

He also warned against the DPWH's alleged practice of substituting projects, saying it constitutes technical malversation.

""Pag nagpasa kami ng budget itemized yan... Pag iniba mo ang paglalagakan ng pondo, technical malversation yan, act pa lang, wala pang ninanakaw,"" he said.

On the proposed 2026 budget, Lacson said senators will move to delete around ₱42 billion in ""ayuda"" or social assistance funds lodged under unprogrammed appropriations, insisting that only foreign-assisted projects should remain under that category.

""Nagtira ang House sa unprogrammed appropriations ng ayuda. Ang naiwan doon P42 billion, tatanggalin namin yan,"" he said in an interview with One News. ""Ilagay natin sa regular budget.""

Lacson, who is known for his sharp scrutiny of the national budget, praised Gatchalian's handling of the Senate budget hearings.

""Maganda ang kanyang pag-aaral. Scrutiny niya maraming nalabas na maanomalya, questionable, red flag. I take my hat off to him,"" Lacson said.",Neutral

"Idineklara ng Manila Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 18 na ang lagda ni Atty. Petchie Rose Espera na nakalagay sa sworn statement ni dating Philippine Marine soldier Orly Guteza na may petsang Setyembre 24, 2025 na isinumite sa Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, ay hindi sa abogado dahil pineke lamang ito.

Sa 11-pahinang dokumento kung saan nakasaad ang resulta ng forensic examination ng National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), sinabi ni Manila RTC Branch 18 Executive Judge Carolina Icasiano-Sison na kinumpirma ng mga imbestigador na ang lagda sa affidavit ni Guteza at ang kanyang actual signature ay hindi rin tumutugma.

""Laboratory comparative examination conducted on the specimens submitted using the stereoscopic microscope, Video Spectral Comparator (VSC4000), forensic image analyzer, magnifying hand lens, and photographic enlargements (comparison chart) reveals the existence of significant fundamental differences in handwriting characteristics and habits between the questioned and the standard specimen signatures PETCHIE ROSE G. ESPERA,"" nakasaad sa report ng NBI na isinumite sa korte.

Dahil dito, inirekomenda ni Sison ang paghahain ng kasong falsification laban kay Guteza at iba pang nasa likod ng pagprisinta ng kontrobersiyal na dokumento kung saan nakalagay ang pekeng lagda ni Espera at iba pang kuwestiyunableng impormasyon na nakasaad doon.

Si Guteza ay ang ""surprise witness"" na ipinakilala ni Sen. Rodante Marcoleta sa pagdinig ng Senate Blue Ribbon Committee noong Setyembre 25, 2025.

“Naging close siya (Bernardo) kay President Erap (Estrada), dahil nga ang Mayor ng Manila eh si Erap, siya ‘yung city engineer, at naging closer siya kay Jinggoy. Kahit papaano nila i-deny ‘yan, wala tayong magagawa,” sabi pa ni Remulla.

"WHY BBM SOUNDED OFF-KEY IN ASEAN
Opinion | Rob Rances

PBBM came out swinging sa ASEAN Summit—blasts on China, full spotlight moment. 

On the surface: bold leadership.
Strategic? Not quite.

Kasi habang siya ay todo-banat, host country Malaysia calmly said: “Let’s handle this internally.”

Translation: ASEAN plays chess, not karaoke.

I. THE ASEAN WAY: QUIET, NOT CONFRONTATIONAL

Since 1967, ASEAN’s strength has never been its volume—but its discipline. 

The “ASEAN Way” rests on three pillars: non-interference, consensus, and quiet diplomacy.

• When Vietnam clashed with China over the Paracels in the 1970s, ASEAN didn’t grandstand; it brokered calm through neutrality.

• When Myanmar’s junta drew global condemnation, ASEAN didn’t issue fiery condemnations—it sent quiet envoys and pushed “constructive engagement.”

• Even with South China Sea tensions, ASEAN avoids naming and shaming. Instead, it works through code-of-conduct talks and collective restraint to avoid escalation.

It’s an orchestra that values harmony over solo performances.

But in this summit, BBM may have thought he was leading the song—but, I think, he ended up off-key. 

ASEAN countries like Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia balance US-China tensions through strategic ambiguity. But the Philippines, under BBM’s tone, sounded more like Washington’s frontman than an independent voice.

II. PRINCIPLED, NOT PROVOCATIVE

Yes, dapat ipaglaban ang soberanya natin, pero may tamang tono at timing. Diplomacy isn’t a concert; it’s choreography. Every word counts.

ASEAN’s real power is subtlety. Every pause has purpose. Every silence has strategy.

And here we are—“blasting” in the room, standing alone in a spotlight that perhaps no one else asked for.

In a region guided by quiet consensus, I think BBM’s message sounded a bit out of rhythm. At a table meant for strategy, his message seemed aimed more at visibility than unity.

III. MY TAKE 

Yes, we must defend our sovereignty and our fishermen. Protect the West Philippine Sea. 

But remember, sa ASEAN, hindi pinaparangalan ang pinaka-matalas magsalita kundi ang marunong mag-strategize.

So, Mr. President, stand firm… but stand wise.

Ipinaliwanag naman ng kalihim na ang problema umano ng mga dike ay “either both rine-restrict ang flow ng tubig, ibig sabihin ‘yung carrying capacity ng mga waterways, lumiliit, but ang more harmful doon ay ‘yung pinapag-bilis niya ‘yung daloy ng tubig.”

“‘Yung velocity of water speeds up at ‘yun ang mas nakakasira at nakakasama,” dagdag pa niya.

Ayon kay Dizon, kung may sapat na datos at ebidensya, baka kailanganin na i-dismantle ang ilang mga flood control project dahil sa kanilang “harmful effects to the communities and environment.”

"SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT?

Vice President Sara Duterte dressed as Disney princess Snow White for Halloween this year—just months after surviving an impeachment attempt at the House of Representatives.

Photos of Duterte in her Halloween costume were shared online by several of her blogger-supporters, drawing renewed public attention amid her ongoing political controversies.

On February 5, the House of Representatives impeached Duterte and immediately transmitted the complaint to the Senate, with 215 lawmakers—more than the one-third requirement under the Constitution—signing in support.

The complaint consisted of seven articles of impeachment, citing betrayal of public trust, culpable violations of the Constitution, graft and corruption, bribery, and other high crimes. Duterte was accused of plotting the assassination of top government officials, misusing confidential funds of the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education, amassing unexplained wealth, and failing to fully disclose her assets in her SALN. It also alleged acts of bribery, destabilization, sedition, and insurrection, as well as the totality of her conduct in office, which was said to constitute grave violations of the Constitution and an abuse of public trust.

However, the Senate later voted 19–4–1 on August 6 to archive the impeachment complaint, following a Supreme Court ruling declaring the proceedings ""null and void ab initio.""

The High Court held that the complaint violated the one-year bar rule and deprived Duterte of due process, effectively voiding the case from the start.

Then-Senate Minority Leader Tito Sotto, then-Senate Deputy Minority Leader Risa Hontiveros, Sen. Kiko Pangilinan, and Sen. Bam Aquino voted against the motion to archive, citing a pending House motion for reconsideration.

The House, through the Solicitor General, has since asked the Supreme Court to reconsider its ruling.

Sa nasabing footage, 8:27am nakarating si Guteza sa institusyon at nanatili muna ito sa opisina ni Marcoleta ng humigit-kumulang 30 minuto bago bumababa sa gallery ng session hall kung saan nagaganap ang pagdinig.

Maalala, si Guteza ang ipinresentang testigo ni Marcoleta sa Senate Blue Ribbon Committee na siyang lumapit daw sa kanya para magboluntaryong magsalita.

Sa testimonya ni Guteza, sinabi niya na kabilang daw siya sa mga taong naghahatid ng maletang naglalaman ng pera sa bahay nina dating HS Martin Romualdez at dating congressman Elizaldy Co.

Samantala, ipinaalam din ng senador na natuklasan ng Executive Judge ng Manila Regional Trial Court na hindi tugma ang pirma sa affidavit ni Guteza sa tunay na pirma ni Atty. Petchie Espera. I via @981724042570614",Negative

Nababahala umano si SP Pro Tempore Ping Lacson kung paano nakaabot kay dating DPWH Secretary Manuel Bonoan ang isang 'memo' mula sa isang sibilyan o non-organic na tauhan ng DPWH.

Ayon kay Lacson, ang sulat-kamay na 'memo' na kanyang tinutukoy ay naglalaman daw ng mga proyektong dapat na inendorso ni Bonoan habang siya pa ang namumuno.

Dagdag pa niya, tila nagsasariling diskarte na raw ito:

How can such a large-scale land fraud occur without officials noticing? Where are the Revenue Department, CMDA, and Chennai Corporation when public land is openly sold and houses are built?

"ASEAN Plays Chess not Karaoke⚡
---------

WHY BBM SOUNDED OFF-KEY IN ASEAN
Opinion | Rob Rances

PBBM came out swinging sa ASEAN Summit—blasts on China, full spotlight moment. 

On the surface: bold leadership.
Strategic? Not quite.

Kasi habang siya ay todo-banat, host country Malaysia calmly said: “Let’s handle this internally.”

Translation: ASEAN plays chess, not karaoke.

I. THE ASEAN WAY: QUIET, NOT CONFRONTATIONAL

Since 1967, ASEAN’s strength has never been its volume—but its discipline. 

The “ASEAN Way” rests on three pillars: non-interference, consensus, and quiet diplomacy.

• When Vietnam clashed with China over the Paracels in the 1970s, ASEAN didn’t grandstand; it brokered calm through neutrality.

• When Myanmar’s junta drew global condemnation, ASEAN didn’t issue fiery condemnations—it sent quiet envoys and pushed “constructive engagement.”

• Even with South China Sea tensions, ASEAN avoids naming and shaming. Instead, it works through code-of-conduct talks and collective restraint to avoid escalation.

It’s an orchestra that values harmony over solo performances.

But in this summit, BBM may have thought he was leading the song—but, I think, he ended up off-key. 

ASEAN countries like Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia balance US-China tensions through strategic ambiguity. But the Philippines, under BBM’s tone, sounded more like Washington’s frontman than an independent voice.

II. PRINCIPLED, NOT PROVOCATIVE

Yes, dapat ipaglaban ang soberanya natin, pero may tamang tono at timing. Diplomacy isn’t a concert; it’s choreography. Every word counts.

ASEAN’s real power is subtlety. Every pause has purpose. Every silence has strategy.

And here we are—“blasting” in the room, standing alone in a spotlight that perhaps no one else asked for.

In a region guided by quiet consensus, I think BBM’s message sounded a bit out of rhythm. At a table meant for strategy, his message seemed aimed more at visibility than unity.

III. MY TAKE 

Yes, we must defend our sovereignty and our fishermen. Protect the West Philippine Sea. 

But remember, sa ASEAN, hindi pinaparangalan ang pinaka-matalas magsalita kundi ang marunong mag-strategize.

So, Mr. President, stand firm… but stand wise.

The best leaders don’t win by “blasting.”

"Imposible na umano na maging state witnesses kaugnay sa flood control scam ang mag-asawang kontratista na sina Sarah at Curlee Discaya dahil sa pagiging ‘uncooperative’ nila sa imbestigasyon sa kontrobersiya, ayon kay Assistant Ombudsman Mico Clavano.

“They are deemed to be hostile witnesses and can only be charged as respondents, in the future – accused, in the case of malversation of public funds, of falsification of public documents, and all the other crimes that they were a part of,” paliwanag ni Clavano sa press briefing ng Office of the Ombudsman nitong Lunes, Oktubre 27.

Iginiit din niya na imposible ring makonsidera bilang state witnesses ang Discaya couple dahil sa mahigit 4,000 project biddings na sinalihan nila, “and kahit ano’ng scheme or scam na nakita natin sa DPWH, kasama sila. So it’s impossible that they can be considered as a state witness for all those crimes that they’ve committed.”

“So choice nila ‘yon, kung gusto talaga nilang maging uncooperative, then the government has no choice but to run after them with every ounce of effort that we can muster,” dagdag pa ni Clavano.

"The Discayas: Scam Artists in Witness Clothing

They walk into hearings like celebrities, heads high, faces smug, as if the nation owes them applause. But beneath that smug grin lies the stench of rot. Pacifico “Curlee” Discaya and Cezarah “Sarah” Discaya aren’t the heroes they pretend to be. They’re not truth-tellers. They’re the fingerprints on every scam the government’s flood-control projects ever saw.

These two didn’t stumble into corruption, they swam in it. Their names pop up in thousands of bids, in province after province, from the Department of Public Works and Highways to local contractors who all swear they’ve seen those same signatures in the same shady circles. Every thread investigators pull ends with the same pattern: the Discayas at the center.

And now they have the gall to stand before the public and demand protection, acting like martyrs who “just want to tell the truth.” Truth? Let’s call it what it is, damage control.

The Crocodile Tears

Their statements don’t line up. One day they claim they were “used.” The next day they act like masterminds who suddenly found conscience. Even senators noticed: their stories shift depending on who’s asking. They cry foul when questioned, then pose for cameras flashing finger hearts like influencers on a break. That’s not remorse, that’s mockery.

How can the same people who fattened themselves on fake contracts now sell themselves as witnesses? The hypocrisy is thicker than the mud their bogus flood projects left behind.

Not the “Least Guilty” -  The Most Involved

Let’s be clear: to become a state witness, the law says you must be among the least guilty. The Discayas? They’re the opposite. They weren’t bystanders, they were architects.

They set up the shell firms, handled the bidding, and moved the cash. Even lawmakers have said it: these two are indispensable to the scam itself. Without them, the whole racket collapses, which makes them ringleaders, not minor players.

So why are they being treated like delicate informants instead of prime suspects? Because that’s how this system always plays its game, turn crooks into choirboys when the heat’s on.

The People Pay Twice

Flood victims still drown in substandard projects, crumbling dikes, useless canals, roads that vanish with the rain. Meanwhile, the Discayas built mansions and now beg for mercy. The only “witness protection” they deserve is from the people they cheated, because the rage out here is real.

You don’t get to rob the nation blind, pocket the flood money, and then claim sainthood when the house burns down. Return the loot. Face the music. Then talk. Until then, every word from your mouths is just another lie dressed in courtroom language.

Curlee and Sarah Discaya are not heroes. They are co-conspirators turned opportunists, trying to rewrite their roles as victims of a system they helped poison. Their testimonies are selective. Their motives are selfish. And their sudden moral awakening? Convenient.

To let them slip into witness protection is not justice, it’s mockery of justice. It’s rewarding the very hands that bled public funds dry. The people deserve full truth, full restitution, and full punishment.

Until that happens, let’s call them what they are: Not witnesses. Not whistle-blowers. Just scammers trying to dodge the flood they themselves unleashed.

"""IKAW ANG DAPAT MAHIYA, MR. PRESIDENT"" 

Matapos ang sunod-sunod na pagsab0g ng mga isyu ng bilyon-bilyong pisong korapsyon sa mga flood control projects, sa kanyang latest video, umalingawngaw ang matalim na mensahe ni dating Ilocos Sur Governor Chavit Singson kay Pangulong  Marcos Jr.

""Ito ang pinakamalaking iskandalo ng korapsyon na nasaksihan ko sa buong buhay ko, matapos kong masilayan ang pamumuno ng walong pangulo ng bansa… Paano niya nasabi na ‘Dapat  mahiya naman kayo sa sarili nyo’? Marahil, ikaw ang dapat mahiya, Mr. President."" 

“This flood control scandal is the biggest corruption scheme I have witnessed in my entire life, having seen eight presidents lead this nation… How can he say ‘You should be ashamed of yourself?’ Perhaps, it is you that should be ashamed of yourself, Mr. President.”

Hindi na raw kayang palampasin ni Singson ang mga ulat ng garapalang korapsyon sa mga flood projects na tila naging “gatasan ng iilan.”
Giit niya, kung talagang walang alam si Marcos Jr. sa nangyayari, mas nakakatakot iyon dahil lahat ng proyekto ay dumadaan sa kanyang kamay.

""Bawat malaking proyekto sa flood control, rehabilitasyon, at imprastraktura—lahat iyan ay dumadaan sa kanya. Siya mismo ang nagrerepaso ng bawat plano at nag-aapruba ng bawat piso.""

"DISCAYAS, 'DI KUWALIPIKADO MAGING 'STATE WITNESS' - ASST. OMBUDSMAN

Sinabi ng isang opisyal ng Office of the Ombudsman na hindi na maaaring matanggap ang mag-asawang kontratista na sina Curle at Sarah Discaya bilang mga ""state witness"" dahil sa ""uncooperative behavior"" nila sa mga imbestigasyon sa multi-bilyong pisong anomalya sa flood control projects.

“There’s absolutely no chance that they can even become state witnesses anymore, because of their statement that they are uncooperative, then they are deemed to be hostile witnesses and can only be charged as respondents in the future, accused in the case of malversation of public funds, of falsification of public documents, and all the other crimes that they were a part of,” sabi ni Assistant Ombudsman Mico Clavano sa press conference ngayong Lunes, Oktubre 27.

Sinabi pa ni Clavano na dahil sa ""uncooperative behavior"" ng mag-asawang Discaya sa mga nakaraang imbestigasyon ng Kongreso, sa halip na matanggap bilang mga ""state witness"" kalaunan ay lumabas pa na ang dalawa ay ""hostile witnesses."" 

Malalim din umano ang naging kutsabahan sa pagitan ng mga Discaya at mga tiwaling opisyal ng Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) na nasa likod ng ""ghost"" flood control projects at ilang opisyal ng gobyerno, dahilan upang makakomisyon umano sila ng bilyun-bilyon.

“We know that they joined over 4,000 bids around the country, and in whatever scheme or scam that we saw within the DPWH, they are part of it,” dagdag ni Clavano.

Matatandaan na si Sen. Rodante Marcoleta ang unang nagrekomenda sa Department of Justice (DOJ) na tanggapin ang Discaya couple bilang mga ""state witness"" subalit hinarang ito ni noo'y DOJ Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla dahil may mga nakita itong indikasyon na pinoprotektahan umano ng dalawa si dating pangulong Rodrigo Dutere sa flood control scam.

“So that is their choice, if they want to be uncooperative, then the government has no choice but to run after them with every ounce of effort that we can muster,” dagdag ni Clavano.

"The Office of the Ombudsman is preparing to file graft and corruption charges against former Ako Bicol Representative @763116735601112 over alleged anomalies in flood control projects. Ombudsman Jesus Crispin @29666241887838 confirmed that several criminal cases are set to be filed before the Sandiganbayan within 30 days, with Co among the officials expected to face prosecution.

The controversy revolves around a ₱289.5 million flood control project along the Mag-Asawang Tubig River in Naujan, Oriental Mindoro. The Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI), formed by Malacañang to audit public works, discovered major irregularities that included incomplete and substandard construction, falsified accomplishment reports, and payments made for phases of the project that were never finished. The ICI’s audit also found that several documents appeared to have been backdated to justify fund releases, prompting the commission to recommend graft, malversation, and falsification charges against Co and officials of the @392192773701614.

The ICI identified Sunwest Construction and Development Corp. as the project’s contractor. The company has long been associated with Co, raising conflict-of-interest concerns. Investigators also uncovered alleged budget insertions and kickbacks linked to other flood control allocations in Bulacan, broadening the investigation into multiple DPWH-funded projects.

During Senate budget deliberations for the Ombudsman’s 2026 funding, Remulla said several current and former lawmakers were implicated in similar cases. He confirmed that Co’s name surfaced prominently in the Mindoro investigation. A subpoena has been issued to Co and 17 others, directing them to file counter-affidavits within 10 days.

Co, who resigned from Congress earlier this year amid the controversy, has denied all allegations. He maintains that the projects underwent proper bidding and complied with government procedures. As of October 24, 2025, the Ombudsman said it is finalizing documents before formally submitting them to the anti-graft court.

If the case proceeds, it could become one of the most high-profile corruption prosecutions under the Marcos administration, testing the government’s resolve to pursue accountability among politically influential figures.",Neutral

Aniya, ito ay napagdesisyunan matapos mapansin umano ng field investigator na “halos parehas” ang sinasabi ni dating DPWH Bulacan 1st District assistant engineer Brice Hernandez sa Office of the Ombudsman at sa DOJ.

“The instruction of the Ombudsman was to harmonize the efforts between the DOJ and fact finding investigation and preliminary investigation units here in the Ombudsman,” saad ni Clavano.

“And maganda naman po ‘yung info sharing namin ng DOJ kaya na-determine po natin na halos parehas po ang sinasabi niya,” dagdag pa niya.

"Tinukoy ng Senate Finance Subcommittee A ang 6,187 “red flag” projects ng Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) sa kanilang panukalang budget para sa 2026, sa ginanap na deliberation ng ahensya ngayong Lunes, Oktubre 27.

Ayon kay Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, hiniling ng komite sa ahensya na tukuyin ang mga station numbers ng mga proyekto upang makita kung saan sila matatagpuan at gaano katagal ang kada proyekto.

“We requested the department to indicate the station numbers so we can see where they are located… and to ensure they are not duplicates,” aniya.

Samantala, sinabi ni DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon na na-verify na umano ng ahensiya ang 798 sa kabuuang 946 na ‘flagged projects’ sa proposed 2026 budget, at kinilala ang mga ito bilang lehitimong proyekto na may kaukulang dokumento at justification.

Ang mga nasuring 798 proyekto ay “continuation projects” na kinakailangan ng karagdagang pondo para makumpleto, ayon kay Dizon.

“Now it is clear, based on the photos, geotags, and straight-line diagrams presented, that these are indeed continuation projects,” ani Dizon sa pagdinig.

The unfolding corruption cases involving over a trillion pesos in flood control funds are a sobering reminder of how public trust can be eroded when accountability is delayed—or denied.

We’ve seen this before. The PDAF scandal dragged on for years, exhausting the public’s patience, only to end with acquittals and no real reckoning. The lesson? A long and tiring process without transparency leads to impunity.

This time must be different.

• We need swift and impartial investigations.
• We demand full transparency in the use of public funds.
• We insist on true accountability, not just legal technicalities.

Let this be the moment we break the cycle. The Filipino people deserve justice—not another forgotten scandal.",Neutral

"CHIZ: LGU PARTICIPATION IN BUDGET PROCESS SHOULD BE A MUST

Sen. Chiz Escudero has called on Congress to demonstrate its commitment to genuine budget reform by giving local government units (LGUs) a greater role in identifying and implementing infrastructure projects under the 2026 national budget.

With deliberations on the proposed ₱6.35-trillion budget still ongoing, Escudero urged the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Committee on Appropriations to allow LGUs to play a more active role in planning infrastructure projects to prevent abuses in the exercise of the ""power of the purse.""

""Ang maaaring gawin agad ng mga pinuno ng Committee on Finance ng Senado at ng Appropriations Committee ng Kamara ay bigyan ng mas malaking papel ang ating mga LGUs sa usapin ng infrastructure projects. Ang mga senador at kongresista ay nariyan lamang para makinig at bigyan daan ang mga pangangailangan ng ating mga taongbayan,"" Escudero said.

In a letter to Senate Finance Committee Chairperson Win Gatchalian, Escudero proposed that the endorsement of Regional Development Councils (RDCs) be made a mandatory requirement for infrastructure projects included in the General Appropriations Act (GAA). He said this reform could be implemented through a general or special provision in the 2026 GAA even before the passage of his proposed Grassroots Infrastructure Planning and Budgeting Act (Senate Bill No. 1459).

""It is unlikely that Congress will have time to pass the bill, but we can already include a provision in the 2026 GAA to implement the same and start the process of cleaning up the budget of unnecessary or worse, non-existing or ghost projects,"" he said.

Escudero explained that requiring RDC endorsements would help ensure that projects are relevant to local needs and protect public funds from corruption and redundancy.

""This will go a long way in preventing the inclusion of projects that are redundant, prone to corruption and have absolutely no benefit for the communities and people where these are situated,"" he added.

The senator cited revelations from recent flood control project investigations, where many LGUs said they were not consulted before projects were included in the National Expenditure Program (NEP).

""Ang mga LGU ang mas nakakaalam kung ano ang kailangan ng kanilang mga lugar pagdating sa mga infrastructure projects. Kaya nararapat at dapat lang na sila ang unang kinakausap bago pa mabuo ang NEP at sa pag-implementa ng mga proyektong ito para walang nasasayang na pera ng taumbayan,"" Escudero said.

Under Senate Bill No. 1459, the RDC endorsement requirement will apply to projects of key agencies, including the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Health, Information and Communications Technology, Interior and Local Government, National Defense, Public Works and Highways, and Transportation.

Escudero said the measure embodies the long-standing principle of bottom-up budgeting to make the budget process more efficient, accountable, and responsive to the needs of the people.",Neutral

“Wala pong basehan ang mga sinasabi na ‘nonexistent’ ang mga ito… Baka kailangan lang ng maayos na coordination para sigurado ang impormasyon hinggil sa mga proyektong ito,” saad ni Atayde.

Samantala, matatandaang nag-viral ang litrato, na ngayo’y deleted na sa Facebook page ng kongresista, kung saan makikita ang P50 milyon halaga ng flood control project sa kanyang distrito.

Makikita rin sa naturang litrato na ang kontratistang may hawak ng proyekto ay ang Wawao Builders, na kasalukuyang iniimbestigahan dahil sa diumano’y pagkakasangkot nito sa mga maanomalyang flood control projects.

"Education Secretary @793211114310994 slammed the Department of Public Works and Highways (@392192773701614) for prioritizing flood control projects instead of addressing the classroom shortage, after revealing that only 22 out of 1,000 targeted classrooms have been completed for 2025.

“Mukhang nawili sila doon sa flood control, sa totoo lang eh. Parang hindi na naging priority ’yung pagtayo ng classroom,” Angara told reporters in Malacañang on Tuesday.

Since 2018, the DPWH has been in charge of constructing @767491417819876-funded classrooms. But Angara said the agency’s workload and red tape have caused delays. To speed up the process, he plans to let local government units (LGUs) take part in classroom construction.

“Gusto na namin baguhin ’yung sistema… Palagay ko, mas bibilis ang proseso. Sa dami na rin ng ginagawa ng DPWH, nahirapan na rin sila,” Angara said.

According to the education secretary, the backlog under the 2025 Basic Education Facilities Fund (BEFF) has reached 900 classrooms, while the nationwide shortage now stands at around 150,000.

Despite the setbacks, Angara expressed confidence in newly appointed DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon and said he expects faster implementation under his watch.

To further boost classroom construction, Angara said the DepEd plans to revive public-private partnerships (PPP), a model used under former Education Secretary Brother Armin Luistro. “Doon, imbis na magpapabid ka ng isang building lamang, nagpapabid ka ng isang libong classroom. Sabay-sabay ’yun,” he said.

He wanted to corner the contract (e-gates). It was a complicated issue, but that kind of impunity has to stop. That’s why I told myself ‘I want to be the ombudsman. I don’t want this’. Imagine, I’m already the secretary of justice and they still meddle with us here, what more with the other (offices)?

He tried to influence the bidding and the Department to revise the Terms of Reference of the project so that only their firm can qualify in the bidding.”

LUCHI CRUZ: “Why would he try to meddle with the awarding of the contract for the project?”

OMBUDSMAN: “For money. They probably have a client who would give them kickbacks. I did not inquire any further. But all that I saw was that they wanted to meddle.”

Boom! 💥 

Sira ang script ng mga DDS. Selective prosecution lang daw ang Ombudsman pero ang totoo, siya ang unang galit kay Zaldy Co dahil may personal experience siya. 👊

At ang balita nga, si Zaldy Co at dalawa or tatlo pang Congressman ang unang masasampolan ng kaso at kulong this November at mag papasko sa kulungan.

"A Nation Held Hostage by Corruption: A Call to Inner Strength and Quiet Joy

We are living in a time when corruption feels invincible—too entrenched, too protected, too shameless. From ghost flood control projects to the Napoles scandal, from two presidential impeachments to the betrayal of EDSA’s promise, we have seen it all. We ousted a dictator, only to welcome his son and witness the worst corruption in Philippine history.

Today, our Congress, Senate, and Executive branch are riddled with impunity. Our judiciary moves at a glacial pace. The powerful protect their own. The corrupt are not punished—they are recycled, defended, and even celebrated.

It is tempting to say: Wala nang pag-asa.
That we are wasting our time.
That justice will never come.

But in the face of this despair, we must choose a different kind of resistance—not loud, not violent, but enduring.

Let us be calm. Let us stay strong.

Let us protect what we still have: our health, our families, our work, our simple joys. Let us raise children who know the difference between brilliance and integrity. Let us honor the quiet heroes—nurses, teachers, farmers, and honest workers—who build this country from the ground up.

Let us find happiness in the small things:

• A child’s laughter at breakfast
• A nurse’s gentle touch in the ICU
• A teacher’s handwritten lesson plan
• A farmer’s harvest after the storm
• A friend’s message that says, “Kaya pa.”

These are not distractions from the fight. They are the reason for it.

We may not see the end of corruption in our lifetime. But we can live lives that reject it. We can build communities that resist it. We can speak truths that expose it.

And we can pray—not just for miracles, but for the strength to endure, the wisdom to discern, and the courage to keep going.

The Filipino people are not weak. We are wounded, yes—but we are still standing.
We are still loving.
We are still laughing.
We are still hoping.

And that, in itself, is a form of victory.

The ASEAN community is anchored on three (3) core pillars — the Political-Security, Economic, and Socio-Cultural — to which the DSWD’s core mandate aligns with. The DSWD ensures it has strong social protection programs that promote human development, invest in the Filipino people, and enhance its overall service delivery across the country.

This year’s Summit, themed “Inclusivity and Sustainability,” underscores the ASEAN’s collective pursuit of unity, resilience, and responsiveness to the aspirations of Southeast Asian nations. A key highlight of the event was the signing of the Declaration on the Admission of Timor-Leste into ASEAN, marking its formal recognition as the regional bloc’s 11th Member State.

"🛑 Statement on Flood Control Anomalies and the Fight for Integrity

Dr. Tony Leachon 

More than a month into the investigation, the revelations from the Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) are deeply troubling. The disclosure by Chairperson Andres Reyes Jr.—that flood control projects are “sold” and divided among participants—confirms what many citizens have long suspected: that corruption is not just a flaw in the system, but a design.

In the face of this, we ask: is there a silver lining?

It’s hard to see one when powerful individuals with money and influence continue to defend their own wrongdoing, conceal the truth, and cover their tracks. 

For many of us, hope feels distant. Trust in institutions is eroded. The suffering of ordinary people—those who endure floods, displacement, and neglect—is compounded by betrayal.

And yet, we will not yield.

We will continue to fight for our rights and principles. We will protect our inner peace and health, even as we confront injustice. We will speak truth, demand accountability, and stand with the few leaders who choose integrity over convenience.

To those who still serve with honor: thank you. May your courage ripple outward.

To the sick, the displaced, the anxious families, and the tireless health workers: we see you. We pray for you.

And to every Filipino who refuses to be silenced—may light and love guide our path, even in the darkest storms.",Neutral

"TERM LIMITS
From Grok, an AI

Proposed Amendment XXX – Congressional Term Limits

Section 1: Term Limits for Members of Congress
No person shall be elected to the House of Representatives more than six times, nor to the Senate more than twice. Service for more than half a term shall be deemed a full term for the purposes of this limit. This limitation shall apply prospectively and shall not affect terms served prior to ratification.

Section 2: Enforcement
Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Federal courts shall have jurisdiction to review and remedy violations.

Section 3: Effective Date
This article shall take effect two years after ratification, allowing for an orderly transition.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(This proposal draws from historical precedents and modern recommendations, aiming for a balanced 12-year maximum in each chamber to foster rotation while preserving institutional knowledge.)

1. What Are the Optimal Limits?
Based on a synthesis of historical debates, empirical studies, and proposed legislation, the optimal term limits for the U.S. Congress are:

Six terms (12 years) for the House of Representatives and
Two terms (12 years) for the Senate. 

This structure aligns with common recommendations from think tanks, polls, and legislative proposals, such as those from U.S. Term Limits and bipartisan bills like H.J. Res. 12 (119th Congress), which suggest similar caps to ensure parity in service length across chambers.

Shorter limits (e.g., three House terms or one Senate term) risk excessive turnover and loss of expertise, while longer ones (e.g., unlimited as current) enable entrenchment. A 12-year cap provides enough time for legislators to gain proficiency—typically 4-6 years per studies on legislative effectiveness—before mandating fresh perspectives.

2. Why?
These limits are optimal because they balance the founders' emphasis on ""rotation in office"" with the practical need for experienced governance, as evidenced by historical writings and modern analyses. Founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson advocated for rotation to prevent abuse and corruption, warning that without it, offices could become hereditary or dominated by entrenched interests; he specifically favored limits for higher offices to ensure periodic renewal. George Mason and Benjamin Franklin supported similar ideas during the Constitutional Convention, viewing term limits as a safeguard against monarchy-like perpetuity, though the final Constitution omitted them, trusting elections instead.

James Madison, in Federalist No. 53, argued against rigid limits, prioritizing accumulated knowledge, but acknowledged rotation's value in preventing ""perpetual incumbency."" Other American thinkers, such as those in the Anti-Federalist Papers, echoed this, fearing unlimited terms would lead to an aristocratic class.

Empirical studies reinforce this: Research from the University of Chicago's Center for Effective Government indicates that 8-12 years allows for policy expertise without the distortions of long-term incumbency, such as reduced responsiveness to constituents.

State-level experiments (e.g., 15 states with legislative term limits) show that 12-year caps increase diversity and innovation but avoid the chaos of shorter terms, like California's initial 6-8 year limits, which led to rushed policymaking. Public support is overwhelming—87% in Pew surveys—crossing party lines, reflecting a consensus that 12 years strikes the right balance between renewal and stability.

3. Pros and Cons of Term Limits
Term limits have been debated since the founding era, with objective analyses from sources like Britannica, Brookings, and NPR highlighting trade-offs. Below is a balanced overview, drawing from academic and think tank research.
Pros:
1. Reduces Incumbent Advantages and Corruption: Limits counteract the 90%+ reelection rates driven by name recognition, fundraising edges, and gerrymandering, fostering competition and reducing special interest influence, as noted in Heritage Foundation analyses. Founders like Jefferson saw this as essential to prevent ""abuse"" from prolonged power.
2. Promotes Fresh Ideas and Diversity: Mandatory turnover brings new perspectives, increasing representation of underrepresented groups (e.g., women and minorities in term-limited states) and aligning with the founders' rotation principle to avoid stagnation.
3. Shifts Focus to Policy Over Reelection: Legislators spend less time campaigning, potentially making bolder decisions, as supported by ACE Electoral Knowledge Network studies.
4. Enhances Accountability: Echoing Anti-Federalist concerns, limits prevent a ""professional politician"" class, returning officials to civilian life as Jefferson envisioned.

Cons:
1. Loss of Institutional Knowledge and Expertise: Experienced members handle complex issues better; studies show term limits lead to less effective legislation and higher reliance on unelected staff or lobbyists, per Brookings and University of Chicago research. Madison argued this in Federalist Papers, valuing tenure for stability.
2. Increases Lobbyist Influence: Novice legislators may defer to external experts, amplifying special interests—a pattern observed in term-limited state legislatures.
3. Potential for Lame-Duck Ineffectiveness: Final-term members might prioritize personal gains or neglect duties, as noted in NPR analyses.
4. Undermines Voter Choice: Elections already serve as ""term limits,"" per founders' faith in democracy; imposing caps overrides voter will, as ruled in U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton (1995). It may also deter qualified candidates without wealth or connections.

Solving for the Best Solution
Considering the founders' mixed views—favoring rotation (Jefferson, Mason) but prioritizing elections and experience (Madison)—and objective modern evidence, the best solution is a constitutional amendment with the 12-year limits proposed above.

This addresses pros like renewal and anti-corruption while mitigating cons through sufficient tenure for expertise, as recommended in studies from nonpartisan sources like Pew and academic reviews. Alternatives like shorter limits (e.g., 8 years) amplify expertise loss, while no limits perpetuate incumbency issues seen in low turnover rates (under 10% voluntary).

To enhance effectiveness, pair with reforms like campaign finance limits or ethics rules, but term limits alone provide a structural fix. Ratification is challenging—over 200 proposals since 1789 have failed—but public support (80%+) and state-level successes suggest viability via a convention of states under Article V. 

This approach honors the founders' intent for a dynamic republic without undermining democratic principles.",Positive

"LACSON: NEXT BLUE RIBBON HEARING ON NOV. 14; 'VERY IMPORTANT WITNESS' TO BE INVITED

Senate President Pro Tempore Ping Lacson said that if he is reelected as chairman of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee when the Senate resumes session on November 10, the panel's next hearing on anomalous flood control projects will be held on November 14.

Lacson said a ""very important witness"" will be invited to the hearing to help expedite the filing of airtight cases against certain politicians, Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) officials, and erring contractors.

He added that retired T/Sgt. Orly Guteza will also be invited to appear before the committee.

""If elected again as Blue Ribbon chairman on Nov 10, our hearing will resume on Nov 14. To help speed up the filing of airtight cases against some politicians, DPWH officials and errant contractors, we will invite among others, a 'very important witness' and retired T/Sgt Orly Guteza to shed more light on his 'sinumpaang salaysay,'"" Lacson said in a post on X.

Guteza was the witness presented by Senate Deputy Minority Leader Rodante Marcoleta during the panel's September 25 hearing. Marcoleta said Guteza was referred to him by former Rep. Michael Defensor.

In his testimony, Guteza claimed he had delivered suitcases of cash—codenamed ""basura"" (trash)—to the homes of former Ako Bicol Party-list Rep. Elizaldy Co and former House Speaker Martin Romualdez. Romualdez has since denied the allegations.

Lacson said the Blue Ribbon Committee left the investigation into the possible violation of Guteza's notarized affidavit to the Executive Judge of the Manila Regional Trial Court, after Atty. Petchie Rose Espera denied notarizing, signing, or participating in the preparation of Guteza's affidavit.

Lacson also confirmed that he has discussed with Senate President Vicente “Tito” Sotto III the possibility of being reinstated as Blue Ribbon Committee chair—a post he vacated on October 6 following expressions of ""disappointment"" from some members of the majority bloc over his handling of the hearings. Several senators have since voiced their support for his return.

The senator maintained that he will continue to uphold impartiality in leading the investigation.

""I will maintain a blindfold mentality, meaning I will be impartial and go where the evidence leads,"" Lacson said.",Positive

Mga Proyektong Naiulat

Ayon sa mga dokumento at ulat, kabilang sa mga proyekto ng Sunwest Construction ang:

Flood control at road infrastructure projects sa Antique, Mindoro, at Albay

LTO Command Center – ₱2B 2021

DepEd ICT/Laptop Infrastructure 2021–2022

Flood management packages sa Western Visayas

Airport at port rehabilitation projects 2023–2025

MGA TANUNG ng PUBLIKO???
Habang tumatagal ang operasyon ng kumpanya sa ilalim ng magkakaibang administrasyon, muling lumilitaw ang mga tanong hinggil sa posibleng “pabor” sa kontrata:

➡️Ang Sunwest ba ay nakakuha ng pabor na kontrata sa gobyerno dahil ito ay dating konektado kay Zaldy Co?

➡️May naging papel ba ang pagiging malapit umano ni Zaldy Co sa dating Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte sa pagpasok ng mga kontratang ito?

➡️Ang Sunwest ba ay nakinabang sa mga proyektong “Build, Build, Build” dahil sa impluwensya ni Co sa mga nakaraang opisyal?

➡️Patunay ba ang sunod-sunod na kontrata na may matibay na ugnayan ang Sunwest sa ilang mataas na opisyal ng nakaraang administrasyon?

➡️Paano tinitiyak ng pamahalaan na patas at transparent ang proseso ng pagpili ng kontraktor?

➡️SUBRANG BUILD na BUILD at Super BUILD ba ang SUNWEST at si ZALDY CO sa pagkakaibigan ng DUTERTE ADMIN?????

Walang direktang ebidensya sa kasalukuyan na magpapatunay ng paboritismo, ngunit nananawagan ang ilang tagamasid ng masusing audit at transparency sa mga proyektong tumatawid ng administrasyon.

Itinuturing ng mga observer na halimbawa ang Sunwest ng kung paanong iisang pribadong kumpanya ay nakapagtuloy ng operasyon at pagkuha ng mga proyekto sa ilalim ng tatlong magkaibang liderato — PNoy, Duterte, at PBBMarcos Jr.

Para sa mga advocate ng open governance, ang ganitong mga pattern ay dapat mag-udyok ng masusing pagsusuri sa bidding process, public disclosure, at performance evaluation ng mga kontratang may malaking halaga.

🗣️ Pahayag ng Transparency Advocates

> “Hindi sapat na alam lang natin kung sino ang nanalo sa kontrata — kailangang malinaw rin kung paano ito nakuha, sino ang nakinabang, at kung gaano kaepektibo itong ipinatupad,” ayon sa isang civil society researcher sa infrastructure governance.

📌Sunwest Construction nakakuha ng tinatayang ₱64.1B na proyekto mula 2015–2025

📌Kontrata ay tumawid sa tatlong administrasyon: PNoy, Duterte, at Marcos Jr.

📌May mga tanong ukol sa dating koneksyon ni Zaldy Co at kung ito’y nakaapekto sa awarding ng proyekto

📌Patuloy ang panawagan para sa transparency, accountability, at fair competition

Zaldy Co at Sunwest PATUNAY naba ang MGA Datos sa loob ng 10 taon KANINO ADMIN sya mas nabigyan ng Pabor???

"The Bureau of Internal Revenue (@984416394525436) may fall short of its 2025 tax collection goal after corruption scandals involving flood control projects disrupted its performance.

Department of Finance (@655837896366129) Undersecretary Charlito Martin R. Mendoza confirmed that the BIR has been hit harder than the Bureau of Customs (@638808770615574) by the issue, dragging down what had been a promising start to the year. Mendoza said the agency was on pace to meet its targets before the controversy slowed down collections.

“For the first half of the year, we were on track to meet the BIR’s collection target. Then there was a bit of a slowdown,” Mendoza said during the 4th SGV Tax Symposium on October 23.

From January to September, total government revenue reached ₱3.37 trillion, an 8.6 percent increase from ₱2.81 trillion in the same period last year. The BIR collected ₱2.32 trillion, up 10.9 percent from ₱2.09 trillion in 2024, covering 72.1 percent of its ₱3.22-trillion goal.

Corporate and personal income taxes, value-added tax (VAT), tobacco excise tax, and the percentage tax on financial institutions drove the BIR’s collections. Meanwhile, the BOC recorded ₱701.7 billion, up 1.6 percent from last year’s ₱690.7 billion, representing 73.2 percent of its ₱958.7-billion target.

Despite the growth, Mendoza admitted the government might miss its ₱4.21-trillion tax revenue target. However, the total ₱4.52-trillion goal could still be within reach through non-tax revenues. These, however, plunged 34.7 percent to ₱314.1 billion due to the absence of last year’s one-time remittances.

Mendoza said reforms are being rolled out to address the slowdown and restore confidence within the bureau. He remains hopeful that collection performance will recover by the last quarter.

The government aims for total revenues equivalent to 15.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025, but for the BIR, the challenge is clear—regain credibility, clean up internal systems, and prove it can still deliver despite the corruption cloud hanging over it.",Neutral

"A Nation Held Hostage by Corruption: A Call to Inner Strength

We are living in a time when corruption feels invincible—too entrenched, too protected, too shameless. From ghost flood control projects to the Napoles scandal, from two presidential impeachments to the betrayal of EDSA’s promise, we have seen it all. We ousted a dictator, only to welcome his son and witness the worst corruption in Philippine history.

Today, our Congress, Senate, and Executive branch are riddled with impunity. Our judiciary moves at a glacial pace. The powerful protect their own. The corrupt are not punished—they are recycled, defended, and even celebrated.

It is tempting to say: Wala nang pag-asa.
That we are wasting our time.
That justice will never come.

But in the face of this despair, we must choose a different kind of resistance—not loud, not violent, but enduring.

Let us be calm. Let us stay strong.

Let us protect what we still have: our health, our families, our work, our simple joys. Let us raise children who know the difference between brilliance and integrity. Let us honor the quiet heroes—nurses, teachers, farmers, and honest workers—who build this country from the ground up.

We may not see the end of corruption in our lifetime. But we can live lives that reject it. We can build communities that resist it. We can speak truths that expose it.

And we can pray—not just for miracles, but for the strength to endure, the wisdom to discern, and the courage to keep going.

The Filipino people are not weak. We are wounded, yes—but we are still standing.

And that, in itself, is a form of victory.

"Senate Hearing on ICI’s Independence

Senator Rodante Marcoleta on Friday questioned the supposed independence of the Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) after it was revealed that the body is currently borrowing prosecutors from the Department of Justice (DOJ) to help draft and review evidence.

During a hearing, DOJ Officer-in-Charge Secretary Fredderick Vida confirmed that the ICI has requested assistance from the department due to limited manpower. Marcoleta, however, stressed that an independent commission should be able to operate and gather information on its own.

“Kapag independent, gagawin niya ng sarili niya. Tingnan mo yung creation niya, it should be independent. Sa pangalan pa lang nga lang eh Independent Commission for Infrastructure,” the senator said.

Marcoleta also raised concerns over the ICI’s authority to seek information from the House of Representatives, the Senate, the Office of the Ombudsman, and other agencies. He warned that such powers may blur institutional boundaries and weaken systems of checks and balances if not properly handled.

“Paano kang independent, ang dami mong kinakasangkapan? Hingi ka nang hingi. You should obtain the information by yourself all alone. Yun ang independent,” Marcoleta added.

In response, Vida maintained a respectful stance and did not directly contest the senator’s assertions.

“We submit to your wisdom, your honor,” he told the panel.

The exchange underscored lingering questions about the ICI’s structure and whether its operational setup lives up to its title as an “independent” body.

Kabilang dito ang asphalt, steel bar, at semento. May ilang pagkakataon din umano na mas mataas pa sa 50 porsyento ang ipinapatong sa market price ng mga construction items.

Samantala, upang matiyak na magagamit nang maayos ang pera ng bayan, inatasan na ni Pangulong Marcos si DPWH Sec. Vince Dizon na babaan ang cost ng mga materials ng 50 porsyento.

“I have directed the DPWH Secretary to bring down the cost of materials by as much as 50 percent which will result in savings in the capital outlay spending of at least P30-45 billion.

Martin Romualdez, ayon kay dating socio-economic planning secretary Winnie Monsod.

Sa interview sa kanya sa ‘On Point’ ng Bilyonaryo News Channel, sinabi ni Monsod na matagal na umanong may reputasyon si Defensor pagdating sa pag-alalay sa mga testigo—na kung hindi umano iniimpluwensiyahan ni Defensor, tinuturuan ng sasabihin, o kaya naman ay nagiging dahilan para bigla na lang maglaho ang testigo.

“At least that’s what I read and that is what I have been reminded of by,” sabi ni Monsod.

Ito mismo ang nangyari kay Guteza, retiradong sundalo ng Philippine Marines, na hindi sumulpot sa tanggapan ng Department of Justice (DOJ) para sa hiwalay na imbestigasyon ng kagawaran, at hindi na nakita pa ng publiko simula nang sorpresang tumestigo sa Senado noong Setyembre 25.

Ayon sa mga ulat, nagsasagawa na umano si DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon ng imbestigasyon para alamin kung anong nangyari, sa kabila ng bilyon-bilyong pondong inilaan sa mga imprastraktura.

Sa gitna ng mga kontrobersiyang ito, maraming netizen  ang nagtatanong kung paano hindi agad nalaman ni Marcos Jr. ang ganitong kalaking kapalpakan sa ilalim mismo ng kanyang administrasyon.

"EX-MARINE ORLY GUTEZA, MULING IIMBITAHIN SA SENATE BLUE RIBBON HEARING

Muling haharap sa Senado si retired TSgt. Orly Guteza, ang ex-Marine na unang nagbunyag ng umano’y male-maletang may lamang ₱48 milyon bawat isa na dinala raw niya sa mga bahay nina dating Speaker Martin Romualdez at dating kongresista Zaldy Co — mga paratang na parehong itinanggi ng dalawang opisyal.

Sa pagbabalik ng sesyon sa Nobyembre 10, nakatakda namang bumalik bilang Blue Ribbon Committee chair si Senador Ping Lacson, na muling magsasagawa ng pagdinig sa Nobyembre 14 upang ituloy ang imbestigasyon sa multi-bilyong pisong flood control scam.

“To help speed up the filing of airtight cases against some politicians, DPWH officials and errant contractors, we will invite among others, a ‘very important witness’ and retired TSgt. Orly Guteza to shed more light on his ‘sinumpaang salaysay,’”
— Sen. Panfilo Lacson

Ang muling pagdinig ay inaasahang magbibigay-linaw sa mga detalye ng salaysay ni Guteza at maaaring magbukas ng mas malalim na impormasyon hinggil sa mga anomalya sa Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).

Si Guteza ay naging sorpresa noong Setyembre 25 hearing, nang isiwalat niyang personal siyang naghatid ng pera sa mga nasasangkot na mambabatas — na ngayon ay iniimbestigahan sa pinakamalaking kaso ng korapsyon sa public works spending sa kasaysayan ng bansa.

"🚨Eric Yap, Paolo Duterte, and the P51-B Flood Control Funds

1. Rep. Eric Yap is the lone district representative of Benguet (former rep for ACT-CIS Party-list) and chaired the House Appropriations Committee from March 2020 to July 2022. [1]

2. DPWH filed graft and malversation complaints (through falsification of public documents) over allegedly paid-for but unfinished or substandard flood-control projects in La Union and Davao Occidental.

The complaints were lodged against 22 DPWH officials and two contractors, Silverwolves Construction Corp. and St. Timothy Corp. [2]

3. Rep. Eric Yap was named a “person of interest” in connection with these projects. 

Ombudsman Boying Remulla and DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon both said Yap appears to be the beneficial or previous owner of Silverwolves. [3]

4. DPWH Usec. Maria Catalina Cabral confirmed that Rep. Paolo Duterte received about ₱51 billion in infrastructure allocations under the last three years of the Duterte administration. 

According to Rep. Terry Ridon, this amount was reflected in the General Appropriations Acts (GAAs) for 2020, 2021, and 2022 for Duterte’s district. [4]

Is it coincidence that these allocations overlap with Eric Yap’s tenure as Appropriations Chair (2020–2022)?

While Paolo Duterte insists there were no anomalies and Yap denies any kickback scheme, the public will know eventually.

Posibleng sa kulungan na mag-Pasko ang ilang akusadong sangkot sa flood control scam, ayon kay Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Sec. Vince Dizon sa isang panayam sa radyo nitong Biyernes, Oct. 24.

Maaaring kabilang daw dito sina dating DPWH-Bulacan district engineers Henry Alcantara, Brice Hernandez at Jaypee Mendoza gayundin ang contractor ng St. Timothy Corp. na si Sarah Discaya.

Kabilang sila sa unang batch ng DPWH officials at contractors na inireklamo ng ahensya para sa paglabag sa Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, Government Procurement Reform Act, at malversation of public funds sa tanggapan ng Ombudsman noong Setyembre.

"The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has filed formal complaints against eight contractor-licensees involved in the flood control projects corruption scandal.

In a statement, the DTI said, through the exercise of its regulatory authority under Executive Order No. 913 (series of 1983) and other relevant trade and industry laws, it has filed complaints against contractors for possible violations of construction industry regulations due to their reported involvement in irregular flood control projects.

The contractors who are the subject of the complaints are eight of the top 15 contractors that cornered 20% of P545-billion worth of flood control contracts, as disclosed by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. in August.

"The Philippine Corruption Scandal Day 88

Of the news regarding this present crisis, I would point out the interview of Karmina Constantino with the Duterte Era Ombudsman Martires of his decision to grant the appeal of Sen Joel Villanueva’s case. It is very ironic that this man pointed out that he acknowledge the human rights of the Senator that’s why he granted it. When this man was given tons of evidence before regarding the human rights violation of the regime of Duterte and did nothing. Impunity and apathy occurred during those time and it is regrettable why a lot still cannot acknowledge the misguidance and still believe in their cult like atmosphere. 

One thing to note since this was a secret decision and unbeknownst to the public, despite it being a public interest matter, Martires must be investigated and the hole he put himself in must be looked at more to get more sense of the gravity his decision made in the pursuit of justice.

"@664138562411848 It’s a dangerous combination when the two black sheep of Philippine politics—Marcoleta and Mike Defensor—join forces. Nothing good ever comes out of that alliance. They fight with everything they have: deception, distortion, and manipulation. Their loud, self-assured tone gives the illusion of intelligence and conviction, but it’s merely camouflage to conceal lies and bad faith.

Now they’re introducing a so-called “witness” whose real purpose is to block the Senate investigation—an act that undermines due process and should be prosecuted.

"Articles of Impeachment

Of the President of the United States
Donald J. Trump

In the House of Representatives

---

Preamble

In the name of the People of the United States of America, the House of Representatives charges Donald John Trump, President of the United States, with high crimes and misdemeanors committed while in office and under color of authority, in violation of his oath to “faithfully execute the Office of President” and to “preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.”

---

Article I — Abuse of Executive Power for Personal Financial Gain

Summary:
Donald J. Trump knowingly and willfully used non-public executive information related to U.S. economic and trade policy for personal and familial financial enrichment through crypto-market manipulation.

Evidence:

1. On or about [insert date], the President publicly announced a new round of Chinese import tariffs.

2. Minutes before the announcement, a large short position was placed against Bitcoin, resulting in a profit of approximately $100–200 million following the ensuing market crash.

3. Public reporting and blockchain analytics indicate that the trade may be connected to entities associated with the Trump family’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial.

4. The timing and coordination of this activity constitute misuse of material, non-public information in violation of 15 U.S.C. §78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5 (SEC Rule 10b-5).

Conclusion:
By exploiting executive privilege to manipulate financial markets for private gain, Donald J. Trump committed acts incompatible with the trust and responsibility of his office.

---

Article II — Obstruction of Justice and Abuse of the Pardon Power

Summary:
Donald J. Trump corruptly exercised the presidential pardon power to shield an individual with direct or indirect financial and political ties to himself and his family.

Evidence:

1. On October 23, 2025, Donald J. Trump issued a full presidential pardon to Changpeng Zhao (CZ), founder of Binance, who had pleaded guilty to criminal charges under the Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws.

2. The pardon followed public reports of overlapping financial interests between Binance and World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s cryptocurrency venture.

3. This act represents a conflict of interest, undermining the integrity of the executive branch and obstructing ongoing regulatory enforcement.

4. Such use of the pardon power constitutes a violation of the Take Care Clause (Article II, Section 3) and an abuse of discretionary constitutional authority for private advantage.

---

Article III — Conspiracy and Violation of the Public Trust

Summary:
Donald J. Trump and associated individuals, including Barron Trump and World Liberty Financial, conspired with external actors to manipulate the U.S. cryptocurrency market using privileged executive information.

Evidence:

1. The entities involved maintained positions in financial instruments affected by official U.S. policy decisions.

2. The President failed to recuse himself or disclose relevant conflicts of interest as required under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 and 18 U.S.C. §208.

3. The President’s actions violated his fiduciary duty to the American people, constituting a betrayal of the public trust and an assault on the impartial administration of government.

---

Article IV — Dereliction of Duty and Breach of Oath

Summary:
By engaging in insider trading, obstructing justice, and abusing executive authority, Donald J. Trump violated the public trust and his oath of office.

Text of Oath Violated:

> “I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”",Neutral

Sa gitna ng malawakang imbestigasyon sa mga iregularidad sa flood control projects, ipinahayag ni Ombudsman “Boying” Remulla na magpapasok sila ng teknolohiya upang mapabilis ang pagbusisi ng mga kaso.

Ayon kay Remulla, pinag-aaralan ng kanyang tanggapan ang paggamit ng Artificial Intelligence (AI) upang mas mabilis na masuri ang libo-libong impormasyon at transaksyon na dumarating sa Office of the Ombudsman.

“Dahil sa dami ng impormasyon at transaksyon, maaaring gumamit na kami ng AI [Artificial Intelligence]…  Kung dati po umaabot ng 6 na buwan at 1 taon ang preliminary investigation, ngayon po iginiit ko pong gawin na namin within 60 days..”

Kung maisasakatuparan, magiging kauna-unahang paggamit ng AI sa anti-corruption investigation sa bansa — isang hakbang na maaaring magbago ng takbo ng hustisya sa Pilipinas.

"🙏 A Prayer of Encouragement for Secretary Vince Dizon 🙏

*thank you for sharing*

Heavenly Father,

We bring before You Secretary Vince Dizon, a man called to lead our nation’s roads, bridges, and flood-control works with purpose. At this moment when the DPWH is facing the weight of scrutiny over numerous flood-control projects involving ghost works, substandard materials, and misused funds, yet flooding still worsens, grant him wisdom beyond his years.

Lord, give him courage to root out entrenched wrongs, clarity to identify where system flaws enabled ghost or incomplete flood structures, and integrity to stand firm even when the winds of criticism blow.

We pray also for peace in his heart. Despite the pressure of leading reform in the face of unfair practices, may he always know that the people support his role and trust in his vision for a clean and effective DPWH. May each project he advances reflect genuine service to every Filipino, especially those who live in flood-prone communities.

Finally, Lord, protect him from weariness and disillusionment. Surround him with a team that shares his upright mission. May his leadership be a beacon of the new, transparent, and accountable Philippines we believe in… guided by our love for country and anchored in the vision of President @861738054403097 for a #BagongPilipinas.

In Your name we pray.

Amen. 🙏🇵🇭

"CAYETANO WARNS OF 'SYSTEMATIC ATTACK' AGAINST SENATE

Senate Minority Leader Alan Peter Cayetano on Thursday warned of what he described as a “systematic attack” against the Senate, as several lawmakers face controversies amid ongoing investigations into the flood control scandal.

""May systematic na attack sa Senate,"" Cayetano told reporters, noting that the recent wave of allegations appears aimed at discrediting the institution. ""Makikita n'yo ngayon in context ng flood control na talagang y'ung iba sa amin ay target talaga... Dinidistract tayo eh. Napapainan tayo nang husto.""

When asked who might be behind the supposed attacks, Cayetano said it could be ""a group of people"" rather than a single mastermind.

""We have some people in our minds, but we'd rather the evidence speak for it,"" he said.

The senator recalled last year's people's initiative campaign, which he claimed sought to ""abolish the Senate."" He believes it was part of a broader scheme by the same masterminds to advance their corrupt plans.

""We all know na habang ginagawa itong People's Initiative, binubuo pala itong scam na ito, hindi lang sa flood control — paisa-isa lumalabas,"" Cayetano said.

The campaign, which aimed to amend the 1987 Constitution by making the House and Senate vote jointly on constitutional amendments, was heavily criticized by senators who warned that it would weaken the system of checks and balances.

Cayetano called on Senate President Tito Sotto to defend the institution from political attacks.

""Kung nangyari ito kay Risa Hontiveros o nangyari ito kay Ping Lacson, kahit nasa Minority ako, tatayuan ko ito. Bakit? May systematic na attack sa Senate,"" he said.

He also urged the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee to remain focused on identifying those behind the flood control scam.

""Eyes on the ball tayo... Dapat administration at opposition, nagkakaisa na ang mastermind ay makasuhan, makulong, ang pera mabalik, at mabago ang sistema,"" Cayetano said.",Negative

"Reps Move to Curb President's Power to Sack EFCC Chairman

The House of Representatives has advanced a landmark bill aimed at strengthening the independence of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) by making it more difficult for a sitting President to unilaterally remove its Chairman.

The bill, which has passed a second reading, is sponsored by Hon. Yusuf Adamu Gagdi (APC, Plateau). It seeks to amend the EFCC (Establishment) Act of 2004 to insulate the anti-graft agency from political influence and align its operations with global best practices.

A key provision of the proposed legislation is to change the procedure for removing the EFCC Chairman. Currently, the President can dismiss the chairman at his discretion for reasons such as misconduct or inability to perform the functions of the office.

The new bill proposes that such a removal would require the approval of a two-thirds majority of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.

In his lead debate during Thursday's plenary, Hon. Gagdi argued that the amendment is necessary to modernize the EFCC's legal framework to effectively combat evolving financial crimes.

He stated that since the Act was enacted in 2004, the nature of financial crime has expanded dramatically to include cybercrime, cryptocurrency manipulation, and terrorism financing, which are not adequately addressed by the current law.

“Furthermore, the existing Act does not provide sufficient guarantees for the independence of the Commission, exposing it to external influence and political interference,” the lawmaker stated.

Gagdi emphasized that the proposed reforms are designed to restore public confidence, enhance transparency, and ensure the EFCC operates as a professional and independent body.

“This amendment will not only ensure Nigeria’s global reputation but also promote good governance, economic stability, and public confidence in the fight against corruption,” he added.

The bill has been referred to the relevant House committee for further legislative action.",Neutral

“They are the first responders sa lahat ng mga rescue missions, at search and rescue operations. Wala ka pong maririnig na reklamo mula sa kanila, that’s why we have to give some dignity naman sa hirap ng ginagawa nila,” pahayag ni Pangulong Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.

Sa kanyang talumpati sa ika-124 na anibersaryo ng Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) na ginanap sa Port Area, Manila, noong Huwebes, Oktubre 23, labis ang pasasalamat ni Pangulong Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. sa PCG dahil sa hindi mapantayang dedikasyon ng mga tauhan nito sa kanilang misyon hindi lang bilang mga tagabantay ng West Philippine Sea ngunit maging tagaresponde sa panahon ng kalamidad.

""In these times when our seas face greater challenges, you remain steadfast, proving that courage knows no tides and that service knows no bounds. You stand as guardians of safety and of stability,” giit ni Marcos.

Dumalo rin sa selebrasyon ang may bahay ni PBBM na si First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos, na may ranggong auxiliary vice admiral, bilang isang reservist ng PCG; at Acting Department of Transportation (DOTr) Secretary Giovanni Lopez, na nanguna sa paggawad ng parangal sa 16 na natatanging miyembro ng hukbo.

Hinati umano sa dalawang phase ang proyekto sa La Union na ibinigay sa Silverwolves Construction Corp. at nagkakahalaga ng P89.7 milyon bawat phase, na may kabuuang halaga na P179.5 milyon.

Sinabi ni Remulla na naging stakeholder umano si Eric sa Silverwolves Construction Corp. noon ngunit “supposedly” ay nag-divest na ang kongresista rito. “But there is reason to suspect that he’s still the beneficial owner of the company,” ani Remulla.

Pinangalanan din ni Remulla si Bulacan 6th District Rep. Salvador Pleyto, president ng S.A. Pleyto Construction Corp., bilang isa sa mga nakatanggap ng pondo mula sa mag-asawang contractor na sina Curlee at Sarah Discaya, ayon sa Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC).

Dagdag ng ahensya, bukas sa publiko ang nasabing auction, kung saan kailangan lang magparehistro at magbayad ng kaukulang fee.

Kasama rin sa proseso ng auction ang rehistro ng sasakyan sa Land Transportation Office (LTO) kapag nabayaran na nang buo ang halaga ng napanalong unit.

"KAYA BA HINDI PA TUKOY ANG ADDRESS NI ZALDY CO? — DOJ: WALA PANG TASK FORCE NA NAGHAHANAP

Tila lumilinaw na ang dahilan kung bakit hindi pa matukoy ng Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) ang kasalukuyang address ni dating Ako Bicol Party-list Representative Zaldy Co — wala pa palang itinalagang task force na naghahanap sa kanya, ayon sa Department of Justice (DOJ).

Sa panayam ng DZRH Balansyado nitong Huwebes, Oktubre 23, kinumpirma ni DOJ Spokesperson Atty. Polo Martinez na wala pang opisyal na grupo mula sa pamahalaan na inatasang maghanap kay Co, na una nang naiulat na nasa Spain.

“As of now, wala pang task force na naghahanap kay Zaldy Co. As far as we’re concerned, that is a law enforcement mandate. Ang law enforcement ang may papel na para maghanap kay Zaldy Co,” pahayag ni Martinez.

Paliwanag pa ni Martinez, hindi saklaw ng DOJ ang mismong paghahanap sa dating kongresista. Ang mandato umano ng kagawaran ay mag-prosecute ng mga kaso matapos ang imbestigasyon ng law enforcement agencies.

“Ang DOJ ang tungkulin po niya ay mag-prosecute ng mga krimen following the investigation conducted by law enforcement,” dagdag pa ng tagapagsalita.

Kaugnay nito, bagama’t patuloy ang imbestigasyon ng Bureau of Immigration (BI), sinabi ni Martinez na hindi pa rin sapat ang impormasyon para maglabas ng opisyal na pahayag ang DOJ hinggil sa lokasyon ni Co.

Ang pahayag ng DOJ ay kasunod ng ulat ng ICI na inaalam pa ang address ni Zaldy Co upang mapadalhan ito ng ikalawang subpoena, matapos siyang hindi sumipot sa pagdinig ng komisyon ukol sa flood control anomalies.

"Cash is King: Ex-DPWH Usec Bernardo’s Billion-Peso Flood Scam Exposed

Habang lubog sa baha ang bansa, si dating DPWH Undersecretary Roberto R. Bernardo naman, lubog sa cash.

Ayon sa Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC), iniwasan daw ni Bernardo ang mga bangko para maitago ang bilyon-bilyong kickback galing umano sa flood-control projects ng DPWH. 

Ang twist? Nang tumaas ang pera, biglang “natuyo” ang bank records niya.

Ayon sa mga dokumentong isinapubliko ng AMLC, lumalabas na mula 2003 hanggang 2025, naging “cash-based” ang lahat ng galaw ni Bernardo — deposits, withdrawals, pati checks — para walang papel na ebidensiya.

👉 2003–2013: Malakas ang galaw ng pera habang nasa Region IV-A pa siya.
👉 2020–2022: Biglang tigil sa bangko kahit na-promote na sa Undersecretary.
👉 2025: Bago pa man ang imbestigasyon, nag-withdraw ng malalaki — halatang inunahan ang freeze order.

Ayon sa AMLC, malinaw ang pattern — “consistent with money laundering.” May 39 bank accounts sa 10 bangko, 59 properties sa Bulacan, at insurance policies sa pangalan ng asawa niyang si Sunshine Miguel Bernardo.

Hindi lang ‘yan — ayon sa whistleblower na si Henry Alcantara, district engineer ng Bulacan, umabot sa ₱6.91 bilyon ang project funds na idinaan kay Bernardo, at ₱5 bilyon dito ay puro ghost projects.

Ang “remittance”? Sa Diamond Hotel parking lot daw, kung saan may “suite” si Bernardo.

At ayon kay Alcantara, may bahagi pa raw napunta kina Sen. Chiz Escudero, Bong Revilla, Nancy Binay, at DepEd Usec Trygve Olaivar (umano’y para kay Executive Sec. Lucas Bersamin).

Matapos mabuko, agad siyang nag-retire noong August 15, ilang linggo lang matapos ang “mahiya naman kayo” speech ni PBBM tungkol sa flood-control corruption.

Ngayon, naka-freeze na ang assets niya, at naghahanda ng kaso ang NBI, DPWH, at Ombudsman.

"PACC’s Camiguin Flip-Flop Exposes a Deeper Rot

How do you go from “₱745.8 million worth of abandoned and defective projects” to “no ghost projects, just right-of-way issues” in five days flat? If you are the Philippine Anti-Corruption Czar (PACC), apparently, it’s just another week on the job.

On October 15, the agency thundered about collusion, corruption, and shoddy materials. They demanded immediate national action, painting a damning picture of Camiguin’s infrastructure program as a monument to waste. Their own words: abandoned, prematurely terminated, substandard.

But by October 20, the same office struck a different tune. Suddenly, there were no ghost projects at all — only delays, caused by routine right-of-way issues. The rhetoric shifted from systemic failure to mundane inconvenience. The corruption crisis vanished into a paperwork problem.

This isn’t just a messaging slip. It’s a credibility collapse. If PACC can swing from sounding the alarm to waving it off in less than a week, why should the public trust any of their findings? Did they uncover collusion, or did they overstate? Did pressure from political patrons twist the narrative?

Infrastructure failures don’t change overnight, but press releases do. What Camiguin residents are left with is a PACC that looks less like a watchdog and more like a weathervane — spinning whichever way the power gusts blow. And that is the real scandal: not just defective bridges, but a defective anti-corruption body, wobbling on its own foundations.

Because if truth can be flipped on and off like a switch, then the rot isn’t just in Camiguin’s concrete. It’s in the institutions sworn to protect us from it.

"“ROMUALDEZ AT ZALDY CO, DAPAT MAKULONG” — MAGALONG

Naniniwala si Baguio City Mayor at dating Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) special adviser Benjamin Magalong na dapat makulong sina dating House Speaker Martin Romualdez at resigned congressman Zaldy Co sa halip na gawing state witnesses sa mga anomalya sa flood control projects.

Ayon kay Mayor Magalong, dapat maranasan ng dalawa ang tunay na hirap ng pagkakakulong sa ordinaryong city jail — at hindi bigyan ng anumang espesyal na pagtrato.

“Dapat silang makulong. Dapat sa ordinaryong city jail sila para maramdaman nila kung gaano kahirap makulong.”

(“They [Martin Romualdez and Zaldy Co] deserve to be jailed. They have to go to an ordinary city jail para maramdaman nila anong hirap makulong,”)

Sa panayam ng News Watch PH, iginiit ni Magalong na ang batas ay dapat pantay sa lahat, at kung layunin ng gobyerno na linisin ang katiwalian, kailangang maramdaman ng publiko na walang sinasanto — kahit pa ito ay mga makapangyarihang politiko.

Democrats who I keep informing you about, who have been in control of our federal government including the House of Representatives and our nation's purse since 1996, are informing Republican Senators of their plans to keep the government closed.

What they're preparing is a minibus, which combines several budget bills into one minibus (3) in lue of an Omnibus that will come with the balance of the budget bills (9).

They never had any intentions of passing bills in Regular Order (12) individuel bills. They're continuing the Omnibus as they have since the Senate took control of the federal government in secret back in 1996 rigging our elections by Congress by ignoring the voters who vote for the party to control the House of Representatives and our nation's purse.

Senate Democrats are still in control and inform Republican Senators of their plans.

"BAM TO PBBM: CERTIFY CAP ACT AS URGENT

Sen. Bam Aquino has urged President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to certify as urgent the Classroom-Building Acceleration Program (CAP) Act as a solution to the country's classroom backlog.

Aquino, author of Senate Bill No. 121 or the CAP Act, said the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) cannot address the problem alone, citing its recent report that only 22 out of its 1,700 target classrooms for 2025 have been completed so far.

""Lahat tayo nagulat nung nalaman natin na bente dos lang ang classrooms na ginawa ng DPWH ngayong taon. Ang backlog natin 145,000 pataas kaya iyong 22 na paggawa ng DPWH, hindi po talaga iyan katanggap-tanggap,"" said Aquino, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Basic Education.

While Senate Bill No. 121 has already been identified as one of the administration's priority measures in the 20th Congress, Aquino said President Marcos should take the next step by certifying the bill as urgent to ensure its swift passage.

""Ang panawagan namin sa Classroom Acceleration Program Bill ay ibigay ito sa mga LGU. Natutuwa kami na sa araw na ito, sinang-ayunan tayo ng Presidente. We're hoping na dahil nag-a-agree na po tayo dito, ise-certify po niya na urgent ang Classroom Acceleration Program para sabay-sabay po tayong gagawa ng mga classroom para sa ating mga kabataan,"" he added.

If passed into law, Aquino said Senate Bill No. 121 will complement the President's directive to channel funds directly to local government units (LGUs) to help expedite the construction of much-needed classrooms.

The senator's proposed measure seeks to decentralize classroom construction by expanding the mandate beyond the DPWH to include LGUs and non-government organizations (NGOs) with a proven track record.

Under the bill, LGUs and NGOs may build classrooms within their jurisdictions in compliance with the Department of Education's standards and guidelines.

""Mahalaga po na ilagay na lang natin iyong responsibilidad ng paggawa ng classroom sa mga grupo at tao na kaya talagang gawin ito sa madaliang panahon at sa tamang presyo,"" Aquino explained.

""Mga local government unit, mga NGO na may track record, sabay-sabay po iyan para ma-address natin iyong napakalaking problema po natin sa edukasyon,"" he added.

During the Senate hearing on the DPWH budget, Public Works Secretary Vince Dizon expressed full support for Aquino's proposal, saying the agency is open to partnerships that will help speed up the construction of much-needed classrooms nationwide.

""We are in full support of this measure, especially now na dalawampu't dalawa pa lang ang nagagawa ng departamento ngayong taon. Kailangan po talaga natin ang tulong,"" Dizon said.

""At this rate, it's virtually impossible na magawa ng DPWH itong kailangan nating mga classrooms,"" he admitted.",Neutral

"CHIZ: PEOPLE, LGUs MUST HAVE A SAY IN INFRA PROJECTS

Sen. Chiz Escudero said local government units (LGUs) and communities should have a decisive role in determining infrastructure projects to be implemented in their areas, especially in the upcoming 2026 General Appropriations Act (GAA) and future budgets.

""Sa dami ng mga lumitaw na problema sa mga government infrastructure projects kabilang na ang mga substandard at 'ghost' flood control projects, kailangan talaga na gumawa ng makabuluhan na solusyon para hindi na nasasayang ang pera ng bayan sa katiwalian,"" Escudero said.

The senator pointed out that many irregularities in infrastructure funding stem from arbitrary insertions made by legislators in coordination with Executive officials—projects that never underwent scrutiny or feasibility evaluation.

""This is the very issue being raised with regard to insertions in the budget,"" Escudero said, noting that several of these ""ghost projects"" were discovered in past GAAs and confirmed by Commission on Audit findings.

To address this, Escudero filed the proposed Grassroots Infrastructure Planning and Budgeting Act, which requires that all infrastructure projects be endorsed first by the Regional Development Council (RDC) and the Provincial, City, or Municipal Development Councils, as well as their respective Sanggunian, before being included in the National Expenditure Program (NEP) submitted by the President to Congress.

""Doon pa lang sa NEP dapat wala ng nakakalusot na proyekto na hindi kailangan ng isang probinsya o bayan,"" he said. ""Mas lalo pang mahalaga ang pag-endorso ng ating mga local government units sa mga proyekto na hinahabol ng mga mambabatas bilang amendment na kadalasan ay naipapasok sa GAA o ang pinal na bersyon ng budget na pinirmahan na ng Pangulo bilang batas.""

Under the bill, the RDC's or local councils' endorsement will be a condition sine qua non for including any infrastructure project in the GAA or releasing funds for its implementation.

""Pag walang endorsement o approval ng RDC, walang pera na ilalabas ang DBM para sa anumang proyekto,"" Escudero emphasized.

The senator urged Congress to prioritize the bill's passage, saying it would help prevent budget abuses and strengthen reforms in the government's infrastructure planning and allocation process.",Neutral

"Inunang kasuhan ni former senator Antonio ‘Sonny’ Trillanes IV sina Senator Bong Go at dating pangulong Rodrigo Duterte dahil ang dalawa umano ang “mastermind” sa kurapsiyon sa flood control projects sa bansa.

Ito ang iginiit ni Trillanes nang ma-interview ng Bilyonaryo News Channel nitong Oktubre 21, sinabing sina Duterte at Go umano ang “nasa likod” ng mga pangunahing sangkot sa flood control scandal: ang mag-asawang kontratista na sina Curlee at Sarah Discaya, si dating Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) undersecretary Roberto Bernardo at ang kapwa dating opisyal ng DPWH Bulacan 1st District na sina Henry Alcantara at Brice Hernandez.

“Hindi niya ina-address ‘yung issue. Bakit nagkaroon ng 200 contracts ‘yung tatay at kapatid niya amounting to P2 billion? Kaya nga ni-raise natin ‘to ulit, dahil hindi naman niya ina-address,” sabi ni Trillanes, tinukoy si Go.

"Rafael ""Apa"" Ongpin has been busy lately, maligning VP Sara and protecting Martin Romualdez - even going so far as telling the ICI how to do their investigation. So, who is Apa Ongpin?

▫️ He was a media man: writer, actor, host, producer and director. 

▫️January 2025 he became executive director of the Makati Business Club.

▫️ He is the son of the late Jaime Ongpin, former Finance Secretary of Pres. Cory Aquino, who committed suicide after he was forced out of Cory's cabinet.

▫️But what's interesting about him is his uncle, Roberto Ongpin.

▫️ Roberto Ongpin, is the chairman of Alphaland Corp. and Philweb where Apa also worked. Just days ago,  Malaysian media reported that ""super crook and fraudster"" Patrick Mahoney has allegedly been advising on the Maharlika Wealth Fund and ""has also been frequently seen with former House Speaker Martin Romualdez"" and  reportedly ""maintains an office and staff back in the Alpha Suites building"" - the building owned by Alphaland Corp.

▫️Roberto was Marcos Sr.'s Minister of Finance. And he is the CEO of Benguet Corporation, the mining company owned by the Romualdez family.

Do they have reason to hate the Dutertes? Yes. Here is the smoking gun:

🔫""In August 2016, Ongpin resigned his post as chairman of PhilWeb Corporation, after being tagged by President Rodrigo Duterte as being part of the oligarchy, which was followed by a subsequent order to halt the online gambling industry, which was the core business of Philweb.""

🔫In 2010, Republic v. Romualdez et al. (Civil Case No. 0035) Sandiganbayan ordered the sequestration of the Romualdez's ""ill-gotten"" shares of Benguet Corporation. Until now, the legal battle continues.",Neutral

“Kaya natin habulin lahat. Nakakagalit at nakakagigil isipin na politicians want to “manage” this crisis by already thinking of compromises,” saad ng dating alkalde sa kanyang Facebook post nitong Martes, Oktubre 21.

Iginiit din niya na hindi lang dapat si Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Secretary Vince Dizon ang humahabol sa kurapsyon: “and’yan ang LAHAT ng mga kalihim ng bawat departamento, ang NBI, ang PNP, ang DOJ, ang Ombudsman, at ICI, at and’yan din dapat ang Kongreso at Senado (eh pinatigil n’yo hearings eh!)”

“Let’s not allow these ideas by politicians to go mainstream. Huwag payagan mamili ang mga politiko kung ano’ng klaseng corruption ang bawal at huhulihin, at lalo ‘wag natin payagan ma-normalize ang corruption just because it is “everywhere”. Hindi guguho ang gobyerno if we GO AFTER ALL of them dahil MADAMING MATINO,” panawagan ni Lino.

“We don't need to know the end game. That's for politicians. We need to do what is right!! When we do what is right, it will LEAD our country to the right path,” dagdag pa niya.

"BULACAN FLOOD CONTROL: CALUMPIT RESIDENTS, 5 BUWANG LUBOG SA BAHA

Halos limang buwan nang lubog sa baha ang Barangay San Miguel, Calumpit, Bulacan, dahilan para lumikas ang mga residente kaugnay sa maanomalyang flood control projects sa lugar.

Ngayong Huwebes, Oktubre 23, ayon sa isang 70-anyos na residente, simula pa noong Hulyo ay nakikitira na siya sa kanyang kapatid matapos magdulot ng malawakang pagbaha ang malalakas na ulan bunsod ng bagyong “Crising.”

Samantala, isang 87-anyos na residente, kasama ang kanyang pamilya, ang pansamantalang nakikituloy sa loob ng isang vulcanizing shop.

Batay sa ulat, kasalukuyan namang nananatili sa mga evacuation center ang 18 pang pamilya.

Dahil dito, apektado rin ang kabuhayan ng mga residente dahil tinatayang 70 porsyento ng mga bahay ang lubog pa rin sa baha.

Giit naman ng mga residente, ito ang pinakamahabang panahon na lubog sa baha ang kanilang barangay na malapit sa Pampanga River, dahilan upang lalo pang tumaas ang tubig tuwing high tide.

"The math:

> 22 ÷ 1,700 = 1.3% completion rate 

> At this pace: 2.2 classrooms per month 

> To complete 1,700: Would need 839 classrooms per month in the remaining 2 months

> This is mathematically impossible

DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon called the rate ""deplorable."" Senator Bam Aquino noted that at this pace, the 165,000-classroom backlog will reach 200,000 by 2028.

Where is the budget? If ₱15-20 billion was allocated for 2025 classroom construction:

> 22 classrooms at ~₱2-3 million each = ₱44-66 million spent

> ₱15-18 billion remains unaccounted for in physical output

Procurement paralysis
Fund utilization
DPWH-DepEd coordination
Possible diversion or misallocation

Justice Undersecretary Jesse Hermogenes Andres made the statement during the Senate sub-panel hearing on the proposed 2026 DOJ budget. Senator Rodante Marcoleta had asked if the agency had filed a request with the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) to freeze the assets of politicians allegedly involved in the issue.

Andres said he could provide the names of those whose assets were affected but clarified that the freeze orders only covered personnel from the Department of Public Works and Highways (@392192773701614). “I do not have copies of that [right now]. And if I may clarify, I think the freeze orders have not touched politicians. I mean, government officials like DPWH officials are already part of the freeze orders,” Andres said.

He reiterated that while DPWH officials’ assets were included, no elected officials were covered. “Government officials, meaning DPWH officials — yes. But elected officials, I do not,” he added.

Andres’ statement contradicted an earlier claim made by former Justice Secretary and now Ombudsman @29666241887838. Remulla had previously said that the AMLC, acting on the recommendation of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), secured freeze orders from the Court of Appeals against the assets of Senators @453051177733422 and @24527930920607, and resigned Ako Bicol Rep. @763116735601112.

"Understanding the Rappler Report on Martin Romualdez’s U.S. Property Transfer

This Rappler headline can easily mislead readers—especially those unfamiliar with U.S. business, financial, or real estate practices—into thinking that a legal transaction involving former House Speaker Martin Romualdez is questionable. At first glance, transferring a ₱130-million (or dollar equivalent) Massachusetts property to a U.S. corporation for just $1 may sound scandalous. However, a closer look shows that such a transaction is neither unusual nor necessarily irregular under U.S. law. 

In the United States, it is common practice for property owners to transfer ownership of real estate from their personal name to a corporation or limited liability company (LLC) that they own or control. This is typically done through a legal instrument known as a quitclaim deed.

The “$1 consideration” often seen in such deeds is merely a symbolic legal formality required to make the document valid—it does not reflect the actual market value of the property. This type of administrative transfer is often used for legitimate purposes such as:
---Estate planning or inheritance management
---Asset protection and liability limitation
---Adding or removing family members from a property title
---Moving property into a trust or business entity for organizational efficiency

These transfers are not considered “sales” in the commercial sense. Similar practices also exist in the Philippines, where families and business owners sometimes move properties into corporations they own for easier management or to separate personal and corporate liability.

In this context, the legal mechanics of the transaction reported by Rappler appear to be consistent with standard U.S. real estate and corporate practices.

However, journalists are also justified in examining the broader context—especially when public officials are involved. While a quitclaim deed transfer may be legal, questions about timing, transparency, and beneficial ownership are legitimate in the public interest. For example, the public has a right to know whether the property continues to appear accurately in a public official’s Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN) after such a restructuring.

Rappler’s article reportedly noted that quitclaim deeds are legal and widely practiced, and included expert opinions to that effect. Still, the presentation may have emphasized the property’s market value compared to the $1 consideration, which could create an impression of irregularity even if none exists.

Ultimately, the transaction itself appears administrative rather than suspicious, and there is no evidence presented of concealment or illegality. But scrutiny of the financial dealings of public officials—no matter how routine those dealings may be—is part of ensuring transparency and maintaining public trust.

To avoid any future misinterpretation—especially during periods of heightened public distrust, such as the ongoing flood control controversy—Rappler should make it a point to clearly and repeatedly emphasize the legality of any transaction it reports on. Doing so will help ensure that readers understand when a transaction is lawful and prevent the public from drawing the wrong conclusions based on headlines or context alone. This make require the journalist to know a little bit about what it is he or she is reporting on. Well, so be it. @966035680810647

"𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗠𝗜𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗨𝗟𝗢𝗨𝗦𝗟𝗬 𝗘𝗫𝗣𝗟𝗢𝗗𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗖𝗢𝗠𝗣𝗨𝗧𝗘𝗥 𝗢𝗙 𝗗𝗣𝗪𝗛: 𝗔 𝗠𝗔𝗦𝗧𝗘𝗥𝗖𝗟𝗔𝗦𝗦 𝗜𝗡 𝗣𝗬𝗥𝗢𝗧𝗘𝗖𝗛𝗡𝗜𝗖 𝗔𝗖𝗖𝗢𝗨𝗡𝗧𝗔𝗕𝗜𝗟𝗜𝗧𝗬!

Yesterday, while the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) was being roasted in investigations over alleged billions in flood control anomalies, fate,  or perhaps engineering genius, to join the show.

At precisely the moment scrutiny was tightening, a computer in the DPWH office reportedly “exploded” and triggered a third-alarm fire.

Now, according to real-world data, the chance of a computer in an office spontaneously bursting into flames is about one in several million per year, roughly equivalent to a stapler achieving sentience or a printer finally working on the first try.

And yet, the DPWH somehow beat the odds.

🖥️ THE STATISTICAL MIRACLE OF THE YEAR

Let’s review the facts:
•The odds of a desktop computer catching fire: ≈1 in 5,000,000 per year.
•The odds of one exploding dramatically: essentially zero.
•The odds of that happening in an office under investigation for corruption: somewhere in the range of “Ask your nearest mathematician, they just fainted.”

If this were an insurance claim, actuaries would file it under “Acts of God, or Guilty Conscience.”

🔍 THE “COMPUTER DID IT” DEFENSE

In an official statement, DPWH spokespeople insisted that the fire originated from a computer unit, not any “sensitive documents.”
Ah yes, the timeless line: “The evidence wasn’t destroyed; it simply got warm.”

The Ombudsman, however, isn’t buying it. He called the blaze “disturbing,” which is bureaucratic code for “Are you kidding me?”

One wonders:
If computers in government offices are now self-immolating, perhaps they’re simply protesting their working conditions — or their user’s browsing history.

🔥 A NEW SCIENCE: CORRUPTOLOGY OF SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION

In the normal universe, overheating happens when dust blocks ventilation or a battery is punctured.
In the DPWH universe, however, corruption allegations appear to generate so much friction that entire PCs ignite out of shame.

Maybe that computer just couldn’t handle another Excel file labeled “Flood Control Project – Confidential.”

The Bureau of Fire Protection and NBI are investigating, but honestly, they’ll need both fire extinguishers and lie detectors for this one.

🧾 THE AFTERMATH: NOTHING TO SEE HERE

DPWH quickly assured the public that “no flood control files were damaged.”
How reassuring. Fires, it seems, have developed the uncanny moral compass to burn only irrelevant items.

It’s the same miracle that often happens when warehouses full of “non-essential” customs documents go up in flames.
Coincidence, of course — our national specialty.

💣 THE EPILOGUE: WHEN CORRUPTION MEETS PHYSICS

If a typical office computer has a 0.00001% chance of exploding, and DPWH is caught in a billion-peso scandal, the probability of this fire being accidental is somewhere between a unicorn sighting and a guilt-ridden laptop committing arson in solidarity.

The whole nation watched smoke rise from Quezon City and thought, “There goes another file backup.”

So here’s the lesson:
In the Philippines, justice is slow, accountability is rare, but combustion is curiously punctual.

Sa isang press conference ngayong Huwebes, binigyang-diin ni Dizon na hindi ang building ng Region IV-B ang nasunog kundi ang Bureau of Research and Standards ng DPWH.

Aniya, nagmula umano ang apoy sa kisame ng ikatlong palapag ng gusali at hindi mula sa sumabog na computer, base sa imbestigasyon ng BFP.

Iginiit ni Dizon na hindi nila binabalewala ang nangyaring insidente at tiniyak na mahigpit ang kanilang pagbabantay sa mga dokumentong may kaugnayan sa imbestigasyon ng flood control anomalies.

Sa ngayon, nagpapatuloy ang masusing imbestigasyon sa BRS upang matukoy ang tunay na sanhi ng insidente. #BrigadaNews

"A Nine-Year-Old Dismissal That Refuses to Die

Nearly a decade has passed since the Ombudsman found Senator Joel Villanueva guilty of funneling ₱10 million in pork barrel funds into ghost projects. In 2016, the Senate brushed it aside, saying only senators can police their own. Villanueva stayed, prospered, and the case was quietly buried.

Now, Ombudsman Jesus Crispin Remulla is digging up the old dismissal order and shoving it back onto the Senate’s desk. The question is simple: will the Senate finally enforce accountability, or will it once again prove that senators live in a republic of their own making?

The implications cut deeper than Villanueva’s seat. If the Ombudsman can’t touch a senator, then corruption cases against lawmakers are paper tigers—press releases with no bite. But if this old ruling is suddenly enforced, it could redraw the lines of power and remind every lawmaker that dismissal orders don’t expire with time or convenience.

In a country where scandals often vanish in the fog of politics, this revival is either a turning point—or another reminder that justice in the Philippines has an expiration date, depending on who you are.

"The investigation into the flood control scandal should not be a family witch hunt, a business leader said on Monday, urging President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to let the investigators do their work and avoid any appearance of political interference.

Apa Ongpin, executive director of the Makati Business Club, told Bilyonaryo News Channel’s “At The Forefront” program that it would be unfair and damaging for Leyte Rep. and former House Speaker Martin Romualdez to be implicated in the controversy without a “fair and independent” investigation.

“That would not be a good outcome for us if he throws him under the bus. It has to be a fair and independent investigation, not at the instigation of Malacañang,” Ongpin told BNC anchor Karen Jimeno.

“They sort of instruct the investigators. It cannot be. It has to be fair. If he’s really got some kind of liability, let that be exposed through proper process… These people, the accused in this thing, all deserve due process,” he added.

Ongpin also rejected insinuations that the Office of the Ombudsman and the Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) were taking orders from Malacañang to target Romualdez.

“They better not be. They (ICI investigators) were appointed to be impartial and they were appointed to be apolitical. They shouldn’t be waiting for a go-signal from the President,” he said.

Romualdez was implicated in the scandal after a supposed former security consultant of resigned Ako Bicol Rep. Zaldy Co claimed that he had delivered suitcases filled with cash to his houses, an allegation he had vehemently denied.

Contractors Sarah and Curlee Discaya earlier claimed that Romualdez and other lawmakers had demanded 30-percent in kickbacks from flood control deals awarded to their construction firms.

Last month, Romualdez stepped down as Speaker of the House of Representatives to allow “full accountability and transparency” amid the controversies over the anomalous infrastructure projects.

Marcos had repeatedly vowed that no one, not even his family members or political allies, would be spared from the ongoing crackdown on those behind the irregularities in the government’s infrastructure projects.

"The usual noisy crowd pointing their greasy fingers at Martin Romualdez like he’s the grand puppeteer of the entire budget process, when in reality, the man wasn’t even part of the bicam committee that cooked it up.  It was Zaldy Co and Chiz Escudero from beginning to end. Come on, #DDShits. If you’re going to scream “insertions!” at least learn how the process actually works before running your mouth like you’re the next COA auditor.

What’s hilarious, or tragic, depending on how you look at it, is how the same #DDShits keyboard warriors are suddenly saints of “transparency” now. But when it comes to the people who actually signed that bicam report, Chiz Escudero, Grace Poe, Win Gatchalian, Cynthia Villar, and a bunch of others, they go dead silent. Not a peep. Not a meme. Nothing. Because apparently, outrage has a party color now.

You can’t be screaming “kingpin” at Romualdez while conveniently ignoring the senators and congressmen who literally approved the document you’re mad about. That’s not activism, that’s selective amnesia wrapped in blind arrogance.

If the #DDShits really cared about good governance, they’d be questioning everyone who had a hand in it, not just the name that gives them likes and retweets. But nah, easier to throw shade at Romualdez, hashtag it “corruption,” and pretend you’ve done your patriotic duty for the day.

Here’s a tip for the #DDShits: facts don’t bend to your bias. If you want to fight corruption, fight it evenly. Otherwise, you’re just another noisy hypocrite in the social media circus.

"CAYETANO WELCOMES LACSON'S RETURN AS BLUE RIBBON CHAIR, CALLS FOR UNITY AND INTEGRITY IN PROBE

Senate Minority Leader Alan Peter Cayetano on Wednesday expressed support for the reinstatement of Senate President Pro Tempore Ping Lacson as chair of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, emphasizing the need for cooperation, transparency, and integrity in the chamber’s investigations.

""As I've said, it's the majority's choice, and the minority respects that. We will continue to work with Senator Lacson in the spirit of cooperation and transparency — because the stakes for our nation are too high for us not to work together,"" Cayetano said in a statement.

He stressed that the focus should not be on leadership changes but on ensuring a fair and unified approach to uncovering corruption and restoring public trust.

""The Blue Ribbon's power lies in its INTEGRITY — in making sure that both our goals of uncovering the truth and the means to achieve them are beyond politics and personal agenda.,"" he said.

Cayetano underscored that while it is easier to use hearings for political gain, the Senate must take the ""harder but more necessary path"" of exposing corruption masterminds and pushing for systemic reforms.

""The Senate is at its best when it rises above partisanship and stands together for truth and accountability. That's the standard the Minority aims for — that's the standard we should all aim for,"" he added.",Positive

"During the Finance Committee Hearing on the proposed budget of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), I emphasized the need for clear and equitable way to plan and distribute infrastructure budgets. I urged DPWH to move away from confusing method and use a simpler, more open process that meets community needs and treats every region fairly.

Some districts with fewer people and smaller land areas still get much larger budgets in both the National Expenditure Program (NEP) and General Appropriations Bill (GAB). This imbalance persists even in areas that are geographically more challenged and have greater identified infrastructure needs. Equity in infrastructure means understanding that districts have different starting points. It involves providing support that fits the specific challenges each area faces. I called for a detailed breakdown of each district's budget so Congress can review these gaps and support more logical, data-based planning. To help fix ongoing issues with overpricing, I suggested a temporary 25% cut to all DPWH line items while the agency reviews real costs.

I repeated how important it is to be transparent when carrying out projects. There should be public access to DPWH’s internal monitoring tools, so people can track progress and take part in oversight. These changes are needed to rebuild public trust and make sure infrastructure projects are accountable.",Positive

"WALANG NASUNOG NA EBIDENSYA?

Tiniyak ng Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) na walang anumang dokumentong may kaugnayan sa mga flood control projects ang naapektuhan sa naganap na sunog sa DPWH office sa Quezon City nitong Miyerkules, Oktubre 22.

“Ayon sa mga record ngayon, ang nasunog sa Quezon City ay walang kinalaman sa flood control projects.”
(“As per record now, the burning in Quezon City does not involve flood control projects.”)
— ICI Chairman Andres Reyes Jr.

Ang pahayag ay inilabas ni Retired Justice Andres Reyes Jr., chairman ng ICI, sa pagdinig ng Senate Committee on Justice and Human Rights kaugnay ng Senate Bill No. 1215 na naglalayong magtatag ng Independent People’s Commission (IPC).

Dagdag pa ni Reyes, bagaman walang flood control files na nasunog, kinakailangan pa ring tiyakin ang seguridad ng mga dokumento ng Commission on Audit (COA) dahil may posibilidad umanong may mga taong gustong sirain ang mga ito.

“Kailangan nating siguruhin ang lahat ng record ng COA… alam ko kasing may mga kriminal na may tendensiyang sunugin ang opisina.”
(“We have to secure all records of the COA because… I know that there’s a tendency for criminals to burn down the office.”)

Una na ring kinumpirma ng DPWH na walang mga dokumento na konektado sa imbestigasyon ng flood control anomalies ang nadamay sa apoy. Ang nasunog na gusali ay ang Bureau of Research and Standards (BRS) na responsable sa pananaliksik, pag-aaral, at pagbuo ng mga polisiya para sa mga proyektong pang-imprastraktura ng gobyerno.

Ang Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) ay nakapagtala na ang sunog ay nagsimula bandang 12:39 p.m., umabot sa third alarm pagsapit ng 12:56 p.m., at tuluyang naapula bandang 1:34 p.m.

"HINDI PA RAW TUKOY ANG KASALUKUYANG ADDRESS NI ZALDY CO — ICI INAAALAM PA

Hindi pa rin tukoy ng Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) ang kasalukuyang address ng resigned Ako Bicol Party-list Representative Zaldy Co, dahilan upang ipagpaliban muna ang pagpapadala ng ikalawang subpoena para sa kanya kaugnay ng imbestigasyon sa umano’y maanomalyang flood control projects.

Ayon kay ICI Executive Director at Spokesperson Atty. Brian Hosaka, inaalam pa ng komisyon ang tumpak na address ni Co upang matiyak na maipapadala ang subpoena alinsunod sa tamang proseso.

“We’re looking at it. We reviewed our records and we just want to make sure that a subpoena should have been sent in accordance with our procedure. So we’re looking at sending another subpoena to him just to be sure that we covered everything,” ani Hosaka.

(“Tinitingnan namin ito. Sinusuri namin ang aming mga rekord upang masiguro na ang subpoena ay maipadala ayon sa tamang proseso. Kaya pinag-aaralan naming magpadala ng isa pa upang masiguro na nasaklaw namin ang lahat.”)

Si Co ay hindi nakadalo sa Oktubre 13 na pagdinig ng ICI, kung saan ipinatawag din si dating House Speaker Martin Romualdez upang magpaliwanag hinggil sa umano’y iregularidad sa flood control at proseso ng pag-apruba ng pondo. Batay sa pinakahuling impormasyon, si Co ay kasalukuyang nasa Spain, ngunit wala pang kumpirmadong lokal na address na maaring padalhan ng bagong subpoena.

"Rappler’s recent headline, “Martin Romualdez Transfers P130-M U.S. Property to Corporation For Just USD1” -- was clearly crafted to provoke outrage. What it leaves out, however, is far more important than what it says. The U.S. property in question was purchased in 1988, decades before Martin Romualdez entered public service. 

This crucial context was not only omitted from the headline but hidden behind a paywall, a deliberate move, perhaps, knowing most Filipinos won’t go past the headline before forming an opinion.

Romualdez has already addressed the issue directly. In his statement, he clarified:

“The U.S. property was purchased before I entered public service, has always been declared in my SALN, and will continue to be so. The arrangement was made solely for property management purposes, no concealment, no irregularity, and no violation of any law.”

This kind of transfer, turning a personally owned property into a corporate asset for a token amount, is a standard and legitimate practice among high-net-worth individuals. It’s a way to manage estate matters, simplify ownership, and protect assets through corporate structuring. Wealthy families worldwide do this to ensure smoother administration, particularly when properties are held overseas. It is not an attempt to hide wealth, but to organize it legally and transparently.

Critics tend to ignore one simple truth, Romualdez was already a wealthy man long before entering politics. Belonging to the well-established Romualdez clan, his affluence is both inherited and publicly declared. His assets have been consistently reported in his Statements of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN), the very document that assures transparency among public officials.

The real disservice here lies in the framing. Rappler’s headline implies wrongdoing without context, then places the full explanation behind a paid membership wall.

It’s a clever tactic, capitalize on outrage, monetize curiosity, and let misinformation spread freely. In an age where people read headlines more than full articles, this approach fuels half-truths and misjudgment.

In truth, there is no scandal here, only selective storytelling. 

Martin Romualdez’s statement stands clear, no concealment, no irregularity, and no violation of any law. The property transfer was a business formality, not a political controversy. What’s missing is not transparency from the former Speaker, but honesty in how the story is told.",Positive

The fire reached third alarm before being declared under control at 1:34 PM and fully extinguished at 1:49 PM. No personnel were reported injured.  

According to initial findings, the blaze originated from the explosion of a computer unit inside the Materials Testing Division.  

In a statement, the DPWH said no documents related to the ongoing investigation into flood control anomalies were stored in the BRS building. The bureau, which is responsible for research and policy formulation for infrastructure projects, has launched an internal probe to determine the extent of damage and prevent similar incidents in the future.

Para kay Senator Loren, mainam na magkaroon ng across-the-board cut o pagbabawas ng 25 hanggang 30 porsiyentong pondo ng DPWH, at isang “clear formula so that if anyone asks why their district gets a certain amount, there is no resentment because the process is based on facts.”

Sa ganitong paraan, buo ang pag-asa ng four-term senator na isa itong “temporary corrective measure” na kayang gawing posible ang isang scientific o makatotohanang pagsusuri ng pondo para sa 2026.

“We are uprooting a system that has been left to worsen, not just in past years, but decades… The changes must not be a mere change of face, but must be a change in systems,” sabi ni Senator Loren.

"BOC to auction 13 luxury cars owned by Discaya couple on Nov. 15 — worth up to ₱200M

Tuloy na ang public auction ng 13 smuggled luxury cars na pagmamay-ari umano ng kontrobersyal na contractor couple na sina Pacifico “Curlee” at Cezarah “Sarah” Discaya.

Ayon sa Bureau of Customs (BOC), gaganapin ang auction sa Nobyembre 15, 2025.

Kinumpirma ni BOC Assistant Commissioner Atty. Vincent Maranilla na ibebenta sa publiko ang mga sasakyan matapos mabigong patunayan ng mag-asawang Discaya ang legalidad ng kanilang importation papers.

“Yung 13 luxury cars ng mag-asawang Discaya, meron kaming warrant of seizure and detention. Since hindi nila mapatunayan ang legal na pagbili at pagpasok ng mga ito sa bansa, ipa-aauction na namin sa Nobyembre 15,” ani Maranilla.

Batay sa imbestigasyon ng BOC, pitong sasakyan ang walang import entry records o certificates of payment, habang ang anim naman ay may dokumento pero peke o kulang sa bayad.

Tinatayang aabot sa ₱100 milyon hanggang ₱200 milyon ang posibleng halaga ng mga sasakyan sa auction. Ayon kay Maranilla, ang kikitain dito ay mapupunta sa mga priority projects ng gobyerno.

“Makakaasa ang mga bibili na dadaan sa tamang proseso at may certificate na ito ay nabili sa auction ng BOC, kaya ligtas itong gamitin,” dagdag ng opisyal.

Matatandaang ang mag-asawang Discaya ay kasalukuyang iniimbestigahan din sa malawakang flood control corruption scandal na iniugnay sa ilang opisyal ng DPWH.",Positive

"Here we go again with a headline that looks scandalous at first glance, pero kung babasahin mo ang buong article, puro assumptions at insinuations at wala namang proof ng “scandal” or even “irregularity.”

This Rappler headline about Martin Romualdez transferring a ₱130-million Massachusetts property to a U.S. corporation for just $1 sounds scandalous.

But based on my own experience living and doing business in the U.S., this is actually normal.

Those who have formed LLCs, S Corps, or C Corps in the States know that this kind of transaction is neither illegal nor unusual.

In the U.S., property owners often use a “quitclaim deed” to transfer ownership from an individual to a corporation they own or control. 

The “$1” is just a symbolic consideration required by law to make the restructuring valid. It has nothing to do with the property’s market value.

And you don’t have to be a politician or a multi-millionaire to do this. 

A quitclaim deed is commonly used by parents transferring property to children, or when adding or removing a spouse from a title after marriage or divorce. It’s also used to move a property into a trust, corporation, or LLC for inheritance or asset management.

In other words, it’s administrative, not a sale.

Syempre, kung hater ka lang na hindi naiintindihan ang asset management dahil wala kang properties or never ka pang nag-register ng corporation, grabe, corruption na agad! 😂

Hindi rin ito alien practice sa Pilipinas ha. Many Filipino families transfer properties to a corporation they own or control for better management and to limit personal liability.

The main reason is exactly that: to limit personal liability. A corporation kasi is treated as a separate legal entity, which means the owner’s personal assets can’t be used to pay the corporation’s debts or legal issues. 

So, kung common practice naman pala yan kahit sa Pilipinas, what’s the big deal?

What’s ironic is that Rappler’s own article admits quitclaim deeds are legal and widely practiced. They even quote U.S. lawyers confirming it’s legitimate for management and estate purposes.

What makes Rappler’s presentation misleading is its fixation on the property’s market value versus the $1 figure, which insinuates “scandal,” “irregularity,” or “concealment” where there is none.

Romualdez’s explanation aligns with legal reality: the property was bought in 1988, long before he entered politics, and has been openly declared in his SALN for years.

(Note: Under the Duterte administration, Ombudsman Samuel Martires required notarized consent before anyone could access SALNs, making public viewing harder.)

If he had declared this property in earlier SALNs, where’s the concealment?

Rappler even mentions that the receiving corporation, AMMY Inc., has Filipinos connected to Romualdez — which proves nothing. So ano naman ngayon?

It’s perfectly normal to include trusted associates or family members in a corporation that manages one’s property. 

In fact, it’s wiser if the owner controls the corporation. Many private owners do that: they form their own companies to hold and protect their assets.

Common practice din naman yan sa Pilipinas, di ba? 

See? May malice din mag-insinuate ang Rappler. Their entire “controversy” is built on optics, not facts.

“Perception is real” talaga in politics, no? The reality is often ignored.

Bawal na ba maging intellectually honest even sa investigative reporting?

It seems what matters is that a topic looks scandalous enough to make readers click and subscribe… only to realize later, “So what’s this article trying to prove? Puro hanash at insinuations lang, nasaan ang actual scandal dito?” 😂

Controversial headlines = more clicks = more subscriptions = more ka-ching! 💸

Actually, depende rin sa nagbabasa. Kung jejemon ka na allergic sa comprehension (or di mo talaga naiintindihan because of lack of experience, which is fair), corruption agad ang basa mo. 😂",Positive

Nagdulot ng pangamba sa publiko ang pahayag ni Cavite 4th District Rep. Kiko Barzaga kaugnay ng sunog na tumupok sa Bureau of Research and Standards (BRS) ng Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) sa Quezon City nitong Miyerkules ng tanghali.

Sa kanyang viral Facebook post, sinabi ni Barzaga na ang insidente ay sumira umano sa mga ebidensiyang nag-uugnay kina Martin Romualdez, Sandro Marcos, Arjo Atayde, Roman Romulo, at Jay-Jay Suarez sa mga anomalya sa flood control projects.

“Ang sunog sa opisina ng DPWH ay sumira sa mga ebidensiyang nag-uugnay kina Martin Romualdez, Sandro Marcos, Arjo Atayde, Roman Romulo, at Jay-Jay Suarez sa flood control anomalies.”

(“DPWH Office Fire destroys evidence linking Martin Romualdez, Sandro Marcos, Arjo Atayde, Roman Romulo, and Jay-Jay Suarez to Flood Control Anomalies.”)

Ayon sa Bureau of Fire Protection–NCR, nagsimula ang sunog sa DPWH-BRS building sa NIA Road, Barangay Pinyahan, Quezon City bandang 12:39 p.m. Itinaas ito sa third alarm pagsapit ng 12:56 p.m., bago tuluyang naapula alas-1:49 ng hapon.

Walang naiulat na nasugatan, ngunit nananatiling palaisipan kung may mga dokumentong naapektuhan—lalo na’t kasabay nito ang mga imbestigasyon ng Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) at Senate Blue Ribbon Committee.

Bilang tugon, tiniyak naman ni DPWH Director Juliana Vergara sa publiko na walang sensitibong dokumento ang nadamay sa apoy.

"Mistulang nagtugma ang magkahiwalay na pahayag nina Ombudsman Jesus Crispin Remulla at former senator Antonio ‘Sonny’ Trillanes IV tungkol sa sinasabing kaugnayan ng mag-asawang contractor na Curlee at Sarah Discaya kay Senator Bong Go.

Ito ay matapos ibunyag ni Trillanes sa interview sa kanya ng ONE News nitong Oktubre 21 na sinabi umano sa kanya ni Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto na si Go ang “nasa likod” ng pag-asenso ng mag-asawang Discaya.

Nagsalita si Trillanes ilang oras matapos siyang maghain ng kasong plunder sa Office of the Ombudsman laban kay Go, sa ama at kapatid nito, at kay dating pangulong Rodrigo Duterte dahil sa pagkakakopo umano ng P7-billion infrastructure projects contracts mula sa gobyerno simula 2007 hanggang 2023.

Nauna rito, ibinunyag ni Remulla sa media na mistulang may mga personalidad umanong pinoprotektahan ang mag-asawang Discaya kaya tumanggi na itong makipagtulungan sa imbestigasyon sa flood control scam—at partikular na binanggit ang pangalan ni Go.

Matatandaang sa Senate hearing noong Setyembre 1, inamin mismo ni Sarah Discaya na nagkaroon ng joint venture noong 2017 ang isa sa mga kumpanya nila, ang St. Gerrard Construction, sa CLTG Builders ni Deciderio Go, ama ng senador.

"CAYETANO ON DPWH MESS: 'I DON'T WANT A REVOLUTION, I WANT A REVIVAL'

Senate Minority Leader Alan Peter Cayetano on Monday urged the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to lead not only in building infrastructure but also in restoring integrity and accountability within the agency, starting with a crackdown on ghost projects.

""I don't want a revolution, I want a revival,"" Cayetano said during the DPWH's budget briefing on October 20. ""Many revolutions did not bring the reforms that were promised. Do you agree with me na dapat yung low-lying fruit, 'yung obvious na obvious, iyon 'yung [dapat] unahin?""

Cayetano called ghost projects the ""clearest and most blatant form of corruption,"" stressing that these should be the department's top priority in its anti-corruption drive.

""Ang definition ng 'ghost [projects],' nag-allocate ng pera [at] binayaran, pero wala talagang project. It's easier to focus on that kasi walang mapapaliwanag 'yung guilty"" he said.

He said the DPWH's mission in nation-building must be twofold—to build infrastructure and to clean up corruption within its ranks—adding that reforms should go beyond prevention.

""The biblical principle is prevent evil, do good, pero if you're going to be spiritual, may isa pa: align with what God wants. If you apply it to civil government, it's not enough that we prevent corruption and do good. We have to align the priorities sa kung ano ang priority ng administration,"" Cayetano said.

DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon agreed, disclosing that more than 400 suspected ghost projects have been identified by a validation team and assuring that those involved will be held accountable.

Cayetano urged swift action, saying the department should use existing documents as evidence and refer cases to the Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) or the Ombudsman if needed.

He also proposed requiring district engineers and local officials to take and submit photos of project sites to help verify progress and prevent ghost projects.

""Reform doesn't come from tearing things down but from rebuilding them right,"" Cayetano said. ""That's the kind of revival our country needs.""",Positive

"Summary of bombshells dropped by Congressman Leandro Leviste in his interview:

💣 1. At least one member of Secretary Vince Dizon’s team [in the DPWH] is a contractor.

💣 2. One USec. met with three contractors and [yung Usec ang] nang hihingi… and Vince Dizon is aware of it.”

💣 3. The DPWH has two categories in the budget called “allocables” and “non-allocables”.

Allocables are like pork barrel budget allocations that a Congressman can touch and revise.

Non-allocables are infra projects under the DPWH that a Congressman cannot touch because allegedly such budget has been “bought” or “reserved” by a contractor in connivance with the DPWH (usually an Undersecretary).

💣 4. Contractors approached him after the 2025 Elections to offer 25% kickback for projects. He was only able to entrap the District Engineer because may papel, may resibo, may computation, and may perang dala.

💣 5. One Congressman-Contractor based in Batangas approached him and offered him 25% kickback as well.

My hunch is that the guy is from a party-list. UUSbong din yung pangalan niyan. WAG madaliin. Or actually, lumutang na nga before eh either sa House or Senate hearing. Or both.

———

Congressman Leandro Leviste also corrects the misinformation going around that he retracted his allegation against Usec. Arrey Perez.

He said that it is still true that Arrey Perez was one of the USecs who has links with contractors AND met with contractors.

What he said that was misquoted or misunderstood by media outlets is there was ANOTHER member of Vince Dizon’s team who was pictured meeting with contractors in a restaurant recently. (Bomb #2 above)

Para daw ito sa mahigit P600 milyon na halaga ng infrastructure projects na napunta sa Tarlac 3G Construction kung saan umano CEO, general manager at presidente si Cong. Rivera habang incorporator at treasurer naman si Vice Mayor Rivera.

Pinahaharap din sila sa mga reklamomg grave misconduct, serious dishonesty, and violation of the government procurement reform act.

Ayon sa DepEd, ilan sa mga dahilan ng mabagal na pagpapatayo ng mga silid-aralan ay ang sobrang daming proyekto ng DPWH, huling pagsusumite ng validation at costing, at mga pagbabago sa pamunuan ng kagawaran.

Dahil dito, tiniyak ng ahensya na isulong ang mas flexible na sistema sa 2026 budget, para hindi na lang DPWH ang makapagpatupad ng mga proyekto, kundi maging ang DepEd mismo.

“Ever since I’ve been firm that the focus should be the modus so we can introduce legislation that will prevent this kind of crime from happening again,” ayon kay Sen. JV.

Ang kanyang pahayag ay kasunod ng pagkumpirma ni Senate President Vicente ‘TiTo’ Sotto III na pumayag na si Lacson na muling maupo bilang chairperson ng makapangyarihang komite.

"The Philippine Anti-Corruption Czar was meant to be the watchdog of public funds — exposing ghost projects, guarding against plunder, and demanding accountability.

But in Camiguin, the mask slipped. October 15, they roared: ₱745.8M in failed projects — collusion and corruption at its worst. By October 21, they applauded: ₱85.2M in “honest and diligent” work.

That is not consistent. That is a contradiction.

"ROMUALDEZ INILIPAT ANG ₱130-M US PROPERTY KAPALIT NG ₱58 ($1)

Sa isang ""kahina-hinala"" at maaaring ituring umano na ""fraudulent conveyance"" ayon sa ilang US lawyers, lumabas na inilipat ni Ex-Speaker Martin Romualdez ang kanyang P130.5 milyong ($2.24M) ari-arian sa Dover, Massachusetts sa kumpanyang konektado umano sa kanyang fraternity brod sa halagang ₱58 o $1 lamang.

Ang property ay pag-aari ni Romualdez mula pa noong 1988, nang bilhin niya ito sa halagang $650,000. Sa ngayon, tinatayang nasa $2.24 milyon na ang halaga ng estate na may lawak na 2.5 ektarya at matatagpuan sa pinakamayamang bayan sa Massachusetts.

Ayon sa investigative report ng Rappler, nailipat ang pagmamay-ari noong Hulyo 29, 2025 sa kumpanyang AMMY INC., ilang buwan bago pumutok ang mga isyu ng korapsyon sa flood control projects at bago ang SONA ng Pangulo.

Ipinaliwanag ni Romualdez sa kanyang pahayag noong Oktubre 21 na:
“Arrangement was made solely for property management purposes.”
(“Ginawa ang kasunduan para lamang sa layunin ng pamamahala ng ari-arian.”)

Dagdag pa niya, walang pagtatago o paglabag sa batas sa naturang transaksyon at matagal na raw nakadeklara sa kanyang Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN) ang nasabing property.

Bagama’t legal ang paggamit ng quitclaim deed sa ganitong transaksyon, itinuring ng ilang US-based lawyers na “fraudulent conveyance” kung ito’y ginamit para itago ang mga ari-arian sa mga posibleng nagsasampa ng kaso o naghahabol ng utang.

Lumabas din sa dokumento na ang AMMY INC. ay pinamumunuan ni Andrew Casiño, isang direktor umano ng Benguet Corporation — kumpanyang pagmamay-ari ng pamilya Romualdez — at frat brother umano ni Martin sa Upsilon Sigma Phi.

"On Rappler's ""Bombshell"" Report

For anyone desperate to find fault in Congressman Martin Romualdez, it is easy to overlook details of facts and hone in on big bold declarations that fit personal biases against him.

The reporting bias here is evident as it skewers disconnected issues together to sway reader sentiments to grill the former Speaker. But for anyone with a taste for deep reading and analysis, they will see that this propaganda dish does the opposite. 

What this report has effectively presented is that Martin Romualdez purchased the Massachusetts property way back in 1988. He was 25 years old and was 19 years away from entering politics. 

This means that this property is in no way, shape or form a part of the discussion of the national budget and its subsequent corruption. He had no access to government funds at the time of its purchase. To say otherwise or to even insinuate its association to current issues is intellectually dishonest and misleading.

Next. It is not uncommon or unheard of in private portfolio management or corporate restructuring to sell properties for $1. This has been practiced by many entities or companies worldwide. (See attached screenshot)
 
Another. The execution of the property transfer predates even a whisper of the DPWH anomalies or the formation of the ICI. In fact, Martin Romualdez was not even re-elected as Speaker at the time. 

This means that the report attaching this matter to the current anti-corruption hearings is clearly just rage baiting its readers. The actual journalism value is quite low.

Where is Rappler's vaunted journalistic practices when it researched, wrote, edited and published this report? The issues meant to draw a picture of malice draws ire instead. This is a hodgepodge series of events without cohesion or congruence.

Mere insinuations and innuendos are and will never be facts. If the intention is to destroy Martin Romualdez, media needs to do better, much, much better than this.",Neutral

Duterte & Mark Villar SHAMELESSLY credit grabbed Pnoy’s big ticket PPPs to conceal their incompetence. 

The P5-6 TRILLION or so that Duterte spent on infrastructure primarily went to flood control & other substandard DPWH projects riddled with corruption!

"PING LACSON, 'DEFINITELY' BABALIK SA BLUE RIBBON COMMITTEE - SOTTO

Sinabi ni Senate President Vicente 'Tito' Sotto III na tiyak nang babalik si Senate President Pro Tempore Panfilo 'Ping' Lacson bilang chairman ng makapangyarihang Blue Ribbon Committee sa pagbubukas ng ng regular session sa Nobyembre.

Base sa report ng https://t.co/ncmxAvwXKG, nagpadala ng text message si Sotto nagsasabing ibinigay na sa kanyang ni Lacson ang kanyang matamis na ""oo"" subalit tumanggi siyang magbigay ng karagdagang detalye.

“In the course of our many conversations, it has come to his attention [that there is a] clamor [from] some of our colleagues and the public that he retake the committee,” sinabi ni Sotto base sa naturang ulat.

Matatandaan na nagbitiw si Lacson bilang chairman ng Senate Blue Ribbon Committee matapos maghayag ang ilan sa kanyang mga kabaro ng pagkadismaya sa ""direksiyon"" na tinatahak ng lupon tungkol sa multi-bilyong pisong anomalya sa flood control projects.

In September 2024, the DPWH gave the green light for the construction of the Tigbauan Multi-Purpose Arena in Iloilo’s 1st District.

Transparency is not optional. Iloilo residents — and Filipino taxpayers everywhere — deserve proof that every peso was used properly. Until then, the project remains under a cloud of questions.

"🚨Courtesy Call or Subtle Interference?🚨

When a foreign official from the U.S. Embassy suddenly makes a “courtesy call” to the ICI the very body currently investigating the multi-trillion peso Ghost Project flood control scandal, the timing alone raises eyebrows.

This is not just a routine diplomatic visit. Courtesy calls are usually made to heads of state, foreign ministers, or economic agencies,  not to an independent investigative commission. Even high-ranking Filipino officials don’t normally “drop by” to greet investigators looking into domestic corruption cases. So why the unusual visit?

In the language of diplomacy, context matters. When an embassy official appears at a sensitive investigation hub, it sends signals, intentional or not, about interest, influence, or involvement. And in a time when billions in infrastructure funds are under scrutiny, this move feels less like “diplomacy” and more like a shadow hovering over accountability.

The ICI’s work is about truth, transparency, and sovereignty. Allowing any foreign presence, no matter how “friendly”, during an active probe risks perception of undue influence. Because if even our own senators or auditors are cautious about making calls that could taint the process, then surely, a foreign envoy should know better.

In moments like this, one must ask:
👉 Is it really a “courtesy call”?
Or is it a “curious call”, a quiet attempt to feel the pulse of a scandal too sensitive for comfort?

The Philippines has fought too long to keep its institutions independent. The least our so-called allies can do is respect the sanctity of our investigations.",Neutral

"On paper, the Sioogom Bridge project in Benguet carries a ₱52.3 million price tag under the 2023 General Appropriations Act. The DPWH billboard proudly declares: “This is where your taxes go.”

But on the ground, what greets locals and passers-by is a rough, unfinished stretch of road, far from the promise of a fully-realized bridge. The timeline says completion by November 2025 — yet today the site reflects more questions than progress.

This isn’t just about concrete and steel. It’s about transparency, accountability, and whether taxpayers can trust that every peso is spent as promised. A signboard should not be the only visible product of millions of public funds.

"Why Did The Original Constitution Of The United States Specify That Senators To Be Elected By State Legislatures?
Why is it referred to as the Upper Chamber? Anybody Know?

It's because the original framework set the House of Representatives to be the representatives of the people in Washington with just 2 year terms so they could be voted out sooner if their performance was insufficient.

The Senate was originally intended to be representation in Washington of the individual states interests, think 10th amendment, and selecting them through the state legislatures rather than popular vote was a means to assure they were of a more sophisticated, better educated better informed pool of candidates dedicated to representing their state's interests in Congress, giving them 6 year terms because of this reasoning.

It was a perfect balance between federal, state and citizen representation in the federal government.

But the 17th amendment altered this well conceived balance between the Federal government, the people and the state's abilities to restrain federal authority and overreach. Basically, it neutered the states influence in Washington DC.

There are several reasons given for this change. One deals with perceived malfeasance or corruption in the Senate, but look what we have now by ratifying the 17th. malfeasance and corruption in the Senate.
The other reason I posit here is that the 17th amendment was ratified the same year as the 16th, just prior to WW1. That's right, a new tax on the people. The income tax. A new tax to fund a war they knew was coming just a year later. Every war since has been funded by the income tax. Every damned one of them, just or unjust, all of them. So why was the 17th ratified? Was it to neuter the states ability to keep us out of that war? I think so.

Our Constitution has been butchered by amendments since it's inception. We need to get back to it's original design. Repeal the 16th and 17th amendments.",Positive

"So, I just wasted my time watching Regal Oliva’s latest reel. 

[To the person who sent me the link to the reel, screw you, napa-react tuloy ako ng bongga. 😂]

In his narration that he reads from a ChatGPT-generated script, he attacked Martin Romualdez in an attempt to appease the DDS dugyot mob who badmouthed and unfollowed him the other day. 

He talked about “grabbing mops” and “walls watching back”. 😂

Bruh, are you writing a script for a  teleserye? 

If this is your type of intelligent content, well, congratulations! You’ve mastered the art of saying something totally dumb with conviction. 

If you remove all those Ang-Probinsyano-like sounds effects, dramatic lighting, tacky makeup, and pretentious wannabe-royalty wig, you basically have ZERO evidence to back your narrative.

To think abogado ka pa sa lagay na yan ha!  

You said: “All documents lead to the desk of Romualdez.” 

Really? I closely follow the flood control issue and not sure what you’re talking about. 

Care to identify which documents you’re talking about?

Wait, you forget that Martin Romualdez is a lawyer who graduated from UP Law and got his undergrad degree from Cornell University? 

Do you think he can’t demolish your narrative with a few arguments? 

Even law students from provincial law schools will laugh at your baseless narrative. 

You think Martin has no access to the best legal minds that can scrutinize every accusation hurled at him including yours? 

Pakilapag ng resibo mo, attorney, para naman ma-scrutinize namin. 

And if it turns out na wala kang resibo, we can then properly and OFFICIALLY categorize you as a DDS propagandist and a fake news peddler. 

The way you narrate, it seems as if you are privy and actually read “the documents that lead to the former speaker”.  

Kung ganun, why don’t your submit these documents to Ombudsman Remulla so he can file non-bailable cases with a penalty of reclusion perpetua against the former speaker PRONTO! 

Isn’t that more impressive and bombastic than wearing a thick makeup doing a lousy monologue in front of a ring light?

In reality, puro ka lang hanash, wala ka naman talagang sinasabi. Typical DDS style. 

Btw, my assistant transcribed your reel and it’s all empty noise from someone desperate to win back those 200K non-thinking DDS who unfollowed you in the last 48 hours. 

So, NO, Regal, you’re not “holding anyone accountable.” You just showed how laughable your “lawyer-for-the-people” projection is. 

You’re a clout chaser pretending to be a crusader. You lost some clout, now you want them back. 

Watching you try this hard to be liked again by the non-thinking DDS rabids is so pathetic. 

######

Transcription of his dramatic monologue: 

He wants the truth. But when the truth begins to surface, he's the first to grab a mop, not to clean, but to erase his footprints. 

Here stands the man who used people to manipulate the budget, endorsed the projects, and now claims to be the one demanding accountability. 

Ang linis ng dating, pero ang baho ang sistema. 

After snubbing the first meeting last October 1, Martin Romualdez finally appeared before the Independent Commission for Infrastructure. 

But this time, the man who once trotted across the halls of Congress, like he owned every wall and surface, seemed... smaller. 

The confidence that once filled the room had melted, the aura of arrogance gone, replaced by a forced composure and the uneasy calm of someone who knows that this time, the walls are watching back. 

And now, as the flood rises, he points his finger not at himself, but at the very people who stood beside him when he held the gable. 

Suddenly, it's Zaldy Co. Suddenly, it's Chiz  Escudero. Ganyan ang husay ng narrative control, the art of washing hands while putting others drown. 

Sa dulo, ang malilinis na pangalan ang laging nalununod sa putik ng pulitika. 

He speaks of transparency, yet every document leads back to the desks he once ruled. 

He talks of accountability, yet his defense is to scatter the blame like sandbags around a sinking ship. 

I want the truth, he says. Then let the truth come, even if it washes over those who once carried his cause. 

Because, sometimes, the dirtiest hands are the ones holding the broom. 

Another day, another Regal POV. 🤮🤮🤮",Neutral

"9 months ago, PBBM described the 2025 GAA as sub-optimal, noting that it no longer reflects the priorities set in the National Expenditure Program. Several key programs were underfunded or left out entirely, resulting in a budget that Malacañang considers less efficient than originally planned. 

For infrastructure projects,  when a project is billed as completed and paid for but appears not to have been done (ghost project / falsified records), he regards that as economic sabotage because of large loss of public funds.

Critics remain critical of the administration's actions to address the issue, but the government has since taken steps to remedy and correct the systemic problems.

PBBM has shown seriousness in uncovering the truth and holding erring officials accountable. In just three months, his administration has taken visible steps to identify irregularities and enforce accountability across key agencies.

ACTIONS TAKEN BY PBBM TO MITIGATE CORRUPTION

✅Publicly disclosed that 15 contractors had allegedly secured 20% of all flood control contracts (P100B out of  P545B) between July 2022 and May 2025. 
✅The contractors were identified and named by PBBM in August 2025.  20% of the entire 545B budget went to just 15 contractors
✅Ordered a deep audit/verification of the flood control projects by DPWH and other agencies
✅The audit flagged that 6,021 out of 9,855 flood control projects lacked specific detail on the type of structure built/rehabbed, covering over P350B. ✅PBBM launched a public complaints portal,
to allow citizen feedback on flood control projects. The complaints website allows citizens to submit feedback, photos, and videos of flood control or infrastructure projects. Encouraging LGUs and civil society to monitor local infrastructure projects.
✅Creation of a special independent fact-finding commission ICI to investigate infrastructure anomalies, including those in DPWH flood control projects. The ICI is tasked with reviewing past projects, issuing subpoenas, referring matters for prosecution etc.
✅Implemented lifestyle checks and asset reviews on government personnel tied to irregular projects.
✅Ordered COA and the Ombudsman to fast-track investigations and coordinate findings for possible prosecution.
✅The appointment of a new DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon, and ordering courtesy resignations from officials at multiple levels to rebuild accountability.  Emphasis that ""even those close to me will not be spared from accountability"".
✅Vetoing and cutting budget items deemed unaligned / introducing transparency steps: Although not specific to DPWH only, the administration signaled that future budgets must align with the national plan (NEP) and pursuing wasted/unprogrammed items will be removed.  Example: Marcos described the budget as ""sub-optimal"" and committed to pursuing savings and realignment.
✅ BSP on its new circular limits cash payouts/withdrawals from banks and other supervised institutions to ₱500,000 (or equivalent in foreign currency) per banking day, whether in a single transaction or a series of transactions.
✅New jail facility for corruption suspects
✅Bureau of Immigration issued Look Out bulletin orders of individuals involved in ghost flood control projects.
✅Henry Alcantara, Brice Hernandez, and Jaypee Mendoza were dismissed due to involvement or implicated in the flood control projects.
✅Preventive suspension of 16 employees of DPWH Bulacan 1st District Engineering Office
✅All DPWH officials (Undersecretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Division Heads, District Engineers) were ordered to submit resignations nationwide as part of the agency's clean sweep.
✅Directed asset freeze and recovery efforts and referrals for prosecution.  The Palace and investigating bodies directed agencies to trace and recover public funds; COA and ICI findings are being referred to the Ombudsman, DOJ or Sandiganbayan as appropriate.
✅Project legitimacy and transparency: Requiring LGU acceptance of projects, stopping projects that have no trace, and improving monitoring. The goal is fewer projects that are paid but not built (ghost projects) and more value for money.

While several officials have been suspended, dismissed, or forced to resign, no convictions have been made. The Palace maintains that prosecutions must be based on solid evidence to ensure cases do not collapse later for lack of proof. 

Until some groups are convicted, our role is to stay vigilant, informed, and engaged. We must demand transparency in how investigations are handled, verify information before sharing it, and support reforms that strengthen oversight and accountability. Real change requires public pressure that is rooted in facts, not noise or speculation, so that anti corruption efforts lead to lasting institutional reform, not just temporary headlines.

"BARZAGA: “PINOPROTEKTAHAN NILA SI ROMUALDEZ!”

Sa gitna ng pagbabalik ni Senador Ping Lacson bilang Blue Ribbon Committee Chairman, binanatan ni Cavite 4th District Rep. Kiko Barzaga si Senador JV Ejercito matapos nitong sabihing maayos ang ugnayan nila ni Lacson at nagbigay pa umano siya ng mga “sinuggest na ipaimbita” sa mga susunod na pagdinig.

Ayon kay Barzaga, ang layunin umano ay upang maprotektahan si House Speaker Martin Romualdez mula sa mga isyung may kaugnayan sa flood control scandal.

“Si Senator JV Ejercito ang nagpabalik kay Senator Lacson sa Blue Ribbon Committee — pinoprotektahan nila si Martin Romualdez.”

Giit ni Barzaga, kung tunay na layunin ng Blue Ribbon Committee ay hanapin ang katotohanan, dapat ay walang sinasanto — lalo na kung ang iniimbestigahan ay mga malalaking personalidad sa gobyerno tulad ni Romualdez.

Wala pang reaksyon si Senador JV Ejercito kaugnay ng ibinabato sa kanya ni Cong. Barzaga.

"After the onslaught of savage public DDS attacks on him, Regal Oliva has decided to try and win back their favor by going after former Speaker Martin Romualdez.

The desperation in his move is palpable. 

The arrogance which he usually flavored his points of view online is visibly dimished. He has crossed the rubicon and the DDS hordes who once marched behind him are now standing against him.

His pathetic attempt to bait the mindless DDS with another Romualdez tirade has fallen on deaf ears. And instead of leading their narrative warfare once again as an outspoken political general, he has made himself a laughing stock among them.

His mask has come off. His make up is washed off by the steady trickle of sweat that will not stop as he realizes that there is no turning back from where his mouth has led him, a barren wasteland, a political oblivion.

He once was a hero among the DDS. He is now a political pariah. No amount of smear tactics on the former Speaker will change that fact.",Neutral

The Blockchain Council of the Philippines (BCP) is proposing a pilot project to put a portion of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) budget on a blockchain ledger. The initiative aims to enhance transparency, accountability, and traceability in infrastructure spending, allowing real-time public access to fund movements.

According to the council, blockchain’s immutable recordkeeping can help prevent budget misuse and corruption, while enabling citizens to track how projects are implemented. If successful, the pilot could pave the way for nationwide blockchain-based fiscal systems, modernizing how public funds are managed and audited in the Philippines.

• 2016: Appointed Undersecretary sa DPWH, during the time when flood control projects and anomalies were rampant.
• 2018: Appointed by President Rodrigo Duterte as Undersecretary for Disaster Resiliency under the Presidential Management Staff (PMS).
Meaning: she wasn’t just a bystander she was inside the system.
She saw how the billions in flood control funds flowed and if she claims to care about accountability, bakit hindi niya ilantad ang mga nakita niya noon?
In short: if we’re investigating DPWH anomalies, Karen Jimeno should be part of the questioning.

• THE SCRIPT: REDIRECT TO MARTIN.
This is the oldest trick in political comms: Redirect the fire to the clean one to protect the guilty.
That’s what’s happening.

While Chiz enjoys the benefit of silence, and Karen Jimeno defends from the sidelines, mainstream voices like Karen Davila amplify the noise against Martin: a Speaker whose signature, attendance, and approval are absent in the documents being weaponized.

• THE DIFFERENCE IN APPROACH: ROMUALDEZ STANDS ON FACTS.

"“KUNG GUSTO NYO MATUKOY PURO BUTETE AT SAPSAP, BAHALA KAYO SA BUHAY N’YO!” 

Uminit ang ulo ni Senador Rodante Marcoleta sa budget hearing ng Department of Justice (DOJ) matapos nitong sitahin ang ahensya sa umano’y dagdag na kondisyon bago maisama sa Witness Protection Program (WPP) ang mga Discaya, na pangunahing testigo sa isyu ng flood control corruption.

Mariin niyang kinuwestiyon kung bakit kailangang isauli muna ng mga Discaya ang umano’y kinita nila bago sila bigyan ng proteksyon ng estado.

“Paano ninyo ipoproseso ang aplikasyon kung kayo mismo ang gumagawa ng rekisitong wala naman sa batas?”

Dagdag pa ni Sen. Marcoleta, tila pinipili lamang ng DOJ ang mga nais nilang iproseso at protektahan.

“So pinipili n’yo ‘yung gusto n’yong i-process?
Sila (Discaya) lamang ang nakapag-identify, initially ng 17 congressmen? At doon sa kanilang mga testimony, lumalabas na rin ang pangalan ni Zaldy Co… at Martin Romualdez. Ngayon kung ayaw n’yong bigyan sila ng protection under that law, kaya siguro umayaw na sila sa ICI.”

Giit ng senador, hindi niya dinidepensahan ang mga Discaya, kundi nais lang niyang matukoy kung sino ang utak ng anomalya.

“Hindi ko dinidepensahan ang mga taong ‘yon. Gusto ko lang ‘yon para ma-identify ang mastermind.”

Binanatan din niya ang DOJ sa umano’y kawalan ng direksyon sa pagpili ng testigo:

“Kung gusto n’yong ang ma-identify ay puro butete at sapsap, bahala na kayo sa buhay n’yo!”

Ayon kay Senador Marcoleta, kung ganito raw ang patakaran ng DOJ, hindi kailanman matutukoy ang mga tunay na nasa likod ng multi-billion flood control scandal.

Now, under PBBM, we finally have a leader with the political will to confront it head-on: he created the ICI, launched Sumbong sa Pangulo and named the top contractors involved.

Yet some people are impatient and now blame him for the very corruption he’s fighting. If we replace the only president brave enough to clean up the system with another Duterte who ignored it, what future are we really choosing for our country?

Why not support PBBM to finish what he started? This magnitude of corruption takes time to dismantle. We must follow due process and the rule of law so the cases won’t just be for show but to ensure that justice is served and the people can finally recover what was stolen from them.

"Iginiit ni Senate President Tito Sotto na walang pinupuntiryang mambabatas o miyembro ng Gabinete si Senate President Pro Tempore Ping Lacson sa flood control scam probe ng Blue Ribbon Committee noong pinamumunuan pa ito ng dating Philippine National Police (PNP) chief.

Ayon kay Sotto, tanging ebidensiya lang ang gumagabay kay Lacson sa pag-iimbestiga ng Senado sa maanomalyang flood control projects sa bansa, kung saan nadawit ang mga kasamahan nilang sina Senators Joel Villanueva at Jinggoy Estrada.

Una nang napaulat na posibleng ibalik si Lacson bilang chairman ng Blue Ribbon, na pansamantalang pinamumunuan ngayon ni Sen. Erwin Tulfo bilang acting chairman.

Ilang senador, kabilang sina JV Ejercito at Raffy Tulfo, ang diretsahang tumanggi na pamunuan ang Blue Ribbon matapos mag-resign si Lacson bilang chairman nito dahil umano sa mga kapwa senador na “disappointed” sa itinatakbo ng flood control projects probe ng kanyang komite.

The Blockchain Council of the Philippines (BCP) is proposing a pilot project to host portions of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) budget on a blockchain ledger. The initiative seeks to test how decentralized records can improve transparency, audit trails, and public accountability in infrastructure fund management.

According to BCP, the system would make budget tracking and contract monitoring tamper-proof, allowing citizens and oversight agencies to verify transactions in real time. The group said it hopes the pilot will serve as a proof of concept for broader blockchain adoption across government procurement and spending programs.

"@9881941870936 With all due respect to Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, the idea that the Senate and House of Representatives alone should determine the tenure of political office holders is fundamentally flawed. These lawmakers are not rulers; they are representatives of the people. Therefore, any decision that directly shapes the destiny of our democracy must be subjected to the consent of the very people they represent. A constitution is not the property of the National Assembly, it is the collective covenant of the Nigerian people. Even the current constitution is a fraud.

A review of the 1999 Constitution, especially on tenure and governance structure, must not be an elite-driven exercise. It must be people-driven, transparent, and rooted in the will of Nigerians. To decide otherwise is to perpetuate the arrogance of a political class that sees governance as a private business, not a public trust.

Now, to the issue itself: a five-year single term would serve Nigeria better. It would reduce the obsession with re-election, compel leaders to focus on governance, and minimize the waste of national resources that comes with endless campaigns. But tenure alone won’t save us unless we fix the culture of impunity that has rotted our system.

That’s why no public office holder should enjoy immunity. No one should be above the law, not the president, not governors, not legislators. If any public officer violates the constitution or betrays public trust, citizens must have the right and mechanism to remove them through due process. Accountability should be non-negotiable.

Equally, no public official should be funded to live in luxury at public expense. No government cars, no bloated convoys. Let those who claim to serve buy their cars and rent their houses  with their own money, as ordinary Nigerians do. Leadership is about sacrifice, not privilege.

Furthermore, the Senate and House of Representatives should be part-time roles. Lawmaking should not be a full-time meal ticket. Our legislators should have real jobs, real businesses, real lives. They should only converge when national duty calls, and be paid sitting allowances, not fat salaries for sleeping through plenary sessions. That’s how you breed public servants, not professional politicians.

And let’s be honest; people like Senator Orji Uzor Kalu represent the rot we are trying to clean. If Nigeria were a serious country, men with credible records of looting state funds would not be pontificating about constitutional reform, they will be serving their sentences. We can not build a nation on deceit, selective justice, and hypocrisy. For too long we’ve pretended that corruption is leadership, and that impunity is wisdom. The decay we see today is the natural harvest of those lies.

If we truly want a new Nigeria, we must start with truth. And the truth is simple: you can not reform a system with the same people who broke it.",Neutral

Ayon kay Sotto, si Lacson mismo ang nakaramdam na tila “may unfinished business” pa siya sa mga kasong iniimbestigahan noon.

“Tingin ko, si Sen. Lacson, 100% na babalik bilang Blue Ribbon Committee Chairman,” ani Sotto.

Dagdag pa ng Senate President, tila hindi pa kontento si Lacson sa takbo ng kasalukuyang mga imbestigasyon kaya’t pumayag itong muling pamunuan ang komite.

“By November 10, we can make it official,” sabi pa ni Sotto.

DS Ortega welcomes MBC call for due process for all, including former Speaker Romualdez in flood control probe

DEPUTY Speaker Paolo Ortega V of La Union on Tuesday welcomed the statement of Makati Business Club (MBC) Executive Director Apa Ongpin, saying he echoed the public’s call for fairness and due process in the ongoing probe on alleged flood control anomalies. 

Ortega lauded Ongpin’s remarks, saying they reflect the same principles of transparency and accountability being advanced by the Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI) and by former Speaker Romualdez himself, who has consistently cooperated with the inquiry.

Deputy Speaker Ortega said, ‘We welcome Mr. Ongpin’s statement as a reminder that justice must never be selective. The process must be based on facts, not political color or pressure,” Ortega said. 

Ongpin said that like anyone else, former Speaker Romualdez deserves due process and a fair, independent investigation.

He also stressed that investigators must act free from political interference and ensure all those accused are given the chance to defend themselves properly.

Ortega emphasized that former Speaker Romualdez had already demonstrated integrity by stepping down as Speaker last month to ensure “full accountability and transparency” amid the ongoing investigation.

“We’ve seen the former Speaker face these issues squarely. He has cooperated with investigators and remains committed to the truth. That’s the kind of leadership the public deserves to see,” Ortega added.

The La Union House leader reiterated that due process is the cornerstone of justice, saying the government’s credibility in its anti-corruption drive depends on impartial investigations.

“Let’s allow the truth to come out through proper process,” Ortega said. “That’s how we uphold the rule of law and protect the integrity of our institutions.”",Neutral

"LIZA ARANETA-MARCOS SINABIT SA FLOOD CONTROL SCAM? 🤔 MEDIA PICKED IT UP PERO ANG BASEHAN, MEDYO KATAWA TAWA

Well, well, well. Parang biglang may plot twist sa flood control issue. 😅

A private citizen named John Santander just sent a letter to the ICI para imbestigahan at kasuhan daw si businessman Maynard Ngu at First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos kaugnay ng umano’y flood control anomaly.

At syempre, mabilis yang nasakyan ng ilang mainstream at online media gaya ng Bilyonaryo at Inquirer, quoting parts of the letter na sinasabing may ugnayan daw si Liza sa negosyanteng si Ngu through appointments, events, at mga connection sa loob ng Palasyo.

Pero teka lang. 🤨 Habang si Maynard Ngu ay totoong iniugnay sa iskandalo ng dating DPWH Undersecretary Roberto Bernardo (na nagtestify pa sa Senate Blue Ribbon na siya raw ang bagman ni Sen. Chiz Escudero), yung parte kay First Lady Liza Marcos ay medyo hilaw pa.

Bakit kamo? Kasi ang basehan ng reklamo ay galing mismo sa libro ni Atty. Vic Rodriguez, yung former Marcos insider turned Duterte loyalist na bitter pa yata hanggang ngayon matapos sibakin sa Malacañang. 😂

So technically, ang “ebidensya” ay mga kwento ng isang disgruntled ex-ally na may sariling tampo sa Unang Ginang. Plus, may mga attached pa raw na photos ng First Lady sa mga events ni Ngu tulad ng Cherry Mobile at Cork Wine Bar, as if attending a public event automatically makes you part of a scam. 🙃

Si Santander naman, sabi niya “hindi daw DDS, hindi Loyalist, hindi Kakampink.” Neutral daw. Pero alam na this, madalas yung “neutral” sa politika nag-aantay lang kung sino ang mananalo bago maglabas ng kulay. 😏

Bottom line: May tunay na kaso laban kay Ngu dahil sa sworn testimony ni Bernardo. Pero isama agad si Liza Araneta-Marcos base lang sa libro ni Vic Rodriguez? Medyo stretch yan. Parang teleserye na gusto lang pasikatin ang kontrabida.",Neutral

Posible kasing tapyasan ng Senado ng ₱348 bilyon ang pondo ng Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) kung hindi maipapakita ng ahensya ang mga dokumentong may kinalaman sa umano’y overpriced na materyales sa mga proyekto nito, kasabay ng pahayag ng Pangulo na ilipat na lamang sa ayuda ang budget para sa flood control.

Nasa P340 billion ang posibleng tapyasin sa budget ng ahensya para sa 2026, ayon sa senador.

Hinimok din nina Senators Bam Aquino at Loren Legarda ang DPWH na mag-implement ng across-the-board cut sa mga proyekto nila, matapos maibunyag ang systematic overpricing sa infrastructure projects ng ahensya, kaugnay sa flood control scam.

Nilinaw naman ni Gatchalian na hindi pa umano final ang halaga ng aalisin sa pondo ng DPWH, “but ‘yan ‘yung mga estimates namin sa ngayon.”

“So kung ang budget nila is about P600 [billion] plus, tanggalin mo ng P340 plus, so mga P350 ang matitira,” ani Gatchalian nitong Lunes, Oktubre 20.

"Should Rep. Leandro Leviste Resign?
Ginamit ba niya ang kanyang posisyon bilang kongresista para lang magpa-pogi sa publiko—kahit kapalit ay ang karera at reputasyon ng isang inosenteng opisyal?
Sa gitna ng isyu ng flood control corruption, biglang bumanat si Batangas 1st District Rep. Leandro Leviste, akusado raw niyang may undersecretary sa DPWH na may koneksyon umano sa mga contractor. Sa sobrang bigat ng paratang, naparesign agad si DPWH Usec. Arrey Perez — isang opisyal na barely 18 days pa lang sa pwesto.
Pero ilang oras lang matapos ang pagbibitiw ni Perez, umatras si Leviste.
“Nagkamali ako ng pangalan,” aminado niyang hindi pala si Perez ang tinutukoy niya, kundi “ibang undersecretary.”
Ang masaklap? Hanggang ngayon, ayaw pa rin niyang pangalanan kung sino talaga.
Perez, na dati ring nagtatrabaho sa Metro Pacific Tollways Corp. at BCDA, ay kilala sa kanyang propesyonalismo. Kaya marami ang nadismaya—pati mga kapwa mambabatas—na napilitang magbitiw ang isang taong walang kasalanan, habang nanatiling kampante ang nagkalat ng akusasyon.
Sinabi ni DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon na hindi niya palalampasin ang anumang uri ng katiwalian:
“We will not tolerate wrongdoing in the DPWH. If evidence is found, we will take swift and decisive action.”
Pero ayon kay Sen. Win Gatchalian, sapat na ba talaga ang mga sabi-sabi para magturo ng tao?
“Hindi puwedeng puro hearsay — puro nabasa, puro may nagsabi. Kailangan ng hard evidence.”
Sa totoo lang, tama si Gatchalian.
Dahil sa isang flip-flop statement, isang public servant ang napahiya, nasira ang pangalan, at napilitang magbitiw — samantalang ang tunay na may kasalanan ay nananatiling hindi pinapangalanan.
Kung si Arrey Perez ay nagpakita ng delicadeza,

"Leviste Admits He Made a Mistake in Tagging a DPWH Official

Batangas Representative Leandro Leviste admitted he made a mistake in naming one of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) undersecretaries he accused of meeting with contractors.

The mix-up began on October 16, 2025, when DPWH Secretary Vince Dizon publicly challenged Leviste to name the officials he claimed were connected to contractors. Leviste responded by naming Undersecretary Arrey Perez as one of them. Hours later, however, after Perez resigned from his post, Leviste clarified that he had identified the wrong person.

He said Perez was not the official in the photograph allegedly showing a DPWH undersecretary meeting with three contractors at a restaurant. According to Leviste, the man in the photo was another undersecretary—someone he still refused to name.

Yet even as he admitted the error, Leviste’s statements only added to the confusion. He maintained that Perez still had “links” to contractors, insisting that most DPWH appointees were being approached by them. He explained that while some officials might refuse to meet with contractors, others did not.

Perez, who had only been in office for 18 days, resigned the same day Leviste made the clarification. In his resignation letter, he said the accusations had turned public service into a political game and that he did not want to become a source of distraction for the department.

The situation left Leviste’s allegations muddled. He had initially singled out Perez as one example of officials involved with contractors, only to retract the specific restaurant‐meeting claim while keeping his broader accusation about contractor ties. This contradictory stance blurred his message—was he targeting individuals or calling out the entire system?

Leviste maintained that his goal was reform: to reduce DPWH project costs and eliminate kickbacks. But his premature naming of Perez, followed by a partial retraction, overshadowed that message and raised doubts about the reliability of his claims.

"Sa pagdinig ng Senado sa panukalang 2026 national budget ng Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), binanggit ni Sen. Loren Legarda ang posibilidad ng isang across-the-board cut o pagbabawas ng pondo sa ahensya.

Ito ay matapos tanungin ng senador si Public Works Secretary Vince Dizon kung sang-ayon ito na magpatupad ng 25 hanggang 30 porsiyentong bawas sa lahat ng infrastructure line items.

Para kay Sen. Legarda, maaaring maging isang “temporary corrective measure” sa 2026 budget ang naturang hakbang upang mas maging “scientific” o batay sa mas maayos na datos at pagsusuri ang pondo para sa 2027.

“If we say, ‘Well, we didn’t do that, it’s still for 2027’—then I won’t be able to sign off on the 2026 General Appropriations Act if we don’t lower the prices of the line items,” sabi ni Sen. Legarda.

"JUST IN | Isiniwalat ngayon ni Land Transportation Office (LTO) Chief Markus Lacanilao na may tatlong proyekto sa loob ng LTO Central Office na ang contractor ay ang Sunwest Inc., na pagmamay-ari ni dating Ako Bicol Representative Zaldy Co.

Partikular ito sa dalawang gusali — isang dapat sanang dormitoryo at isang Information Technology (IT) hub — na nagkakahalaga ng halos tig-kalahating bilyong piso kada isa, at isang Central Command Center na nagkakahalaga ng 946 milyong piso.

Ayon kay Lacanilao, sinimulang imbestigahan ang tatlong proyekto matapos mapansin na “underutilized” o hindi napapakinabangan nang husto ang mga gusali.

Sa imbestigasyon, natukoy na sinimulan ang mga proyekto noong 2021 at nabayaran ito noong Disyembre 2024. | via Merry Ann Bastasa

Ang letter request ay isinumite ni John Santander ngayong Martes, Oktubre 21, kay ICI Chairman retired Justice Andres Reyes dahil ipinagtataka ng huli kung bakit hindi pa pinatatawag ng ICI si Ngu, CEO ng Cherry Mobile, sa imbestigasyon.

Unang nabanggit si Ngu sa flood control scam probe na diumano’y umaktong ‘bagman’ ni Sen. Francis ‘Chiz’ Escudero sa pagtanggap ng kickback mula sa maanomalyang proyekto.

“But I wish to impress upon the commission a lead that has not been explored – the possibility that First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos benefited as well from Maynard Ngu and/or vice versa,” nakasaad sa liham ni Santander kay Reyes.

Binigyang-diin din niya na noong pinamunuan ni Sen. Francis “Chiz” Escudero ang Senado, kahit na may banta ng Senate coup, ay nagpatuloy umano ang pagtatrabaho nang walang “drama o intrigue.”

“The leadership under SP Chiz made a decision, stood by it, and moved forward with respect for the institution. That's how professional and mature leadership behaves when tested,” saad pa ni Cayetano.

"Prioritise people's welfare, ensure transparency, Speaker Abbas charges SSDC

The Speaker of the House of Representatives Rt. Hon. Abbas Tajudeen, Ph.D., GCON, has urged the South South Development Commission (SSDC) to live up to its mandate by bringing development to the people especially at the grassroots.

Speaker Abbas particularly urged the SSDC to address the socio-economic challenges for which the Commission was created.

The Speaker gave the charge on Thursday when the board and management of the SSDC visited him in Abuja.

“This is an opportunity to set a legacy for future generations. Serve with integrity, coordination, and vision,” Speaker Abbas admonished the SSDC leadership, just as he urged the board and the management to prioritise the best interest of the South-South people.

While urging them to work closely with state governors to improve synergy, the Speaker warned against corruption, including duplication of projects, and mandates. He also called for the building of a strong institutional foundation for the future.

Speaker Abbas also advised the SSDC to conduct proper needs assessments before interventions.

The Speaker expressed the commitment of the House to giving full support to the SSDC to deliver sustainable development and stability to the South-South geopolitical zone.

The Managing Director, SSDC, Mrs Usoro Offiong Akpabio, who led the delegation, earlier said the Commission is ready to commence full operations.

Mrs Akpabio also noted that the mandate of the SSDC is in line with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda.

The SSDC boss also highlighted some of the Commission’s programmes and projects which cover infrastructure renewal, human capital development, environmental protection, as well as youth and women empowerment.

Mrs Akpabio pledged accountability and transparency under her watch as MD of the SSDC.",Positive
